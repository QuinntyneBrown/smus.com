<p>Hello from the west coast!</p>

<p>My passion is to invent and build enjoyable, useful, and novel user
interfaces at the cusp of hardware and software. I am a proficient
front-end and mobile engineer with experience leading teams. In my
projects, I tend to gravitate to web technologies because of the
flexibility of the web platform. My professional interests include
education, audio and music, sensors and interaction design.</p>

<p>My job at Google is a mix of software engineering and user experience
prototyping. I have had the good fortune to help launch <a href="http://g.co/cardboard">Google
Cardboard</a>, <a href="http://g.co/tone">Google Tone</a>, and build many other exciting
products with a small, fast moving team.</p>

<p>At my previous job as an engineer on the Chrome developer relations team
we pushed the limits of the modern web platform and educated web
developers. I helped launch <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&amp;hl=en">Chrome for Android</a>, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">wrote
articles</a>, <a href="/talks">gave talks</a> and released open source libraries
and samples. I also authored a short <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Audio-API-Boris-Smus/dp/1449332684">book on the Web Audio API</a>.</p>

<p>I hold a masters in HCI from <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci">Carnegie Mellon</a>, where I focused on social
and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bIgFmUwAAAAJ">wearable computing research</a> and built <a href="http://crowdforge.com/">CrowdForge</a>,
a system for crowdsourcing complex tasks. Prior to that, I worked at Apple for
two years, contributing to iWeb, iWork and helping start <a href="https://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/">iWork.com</a>. For
the still curious, my <a href="/resume">resume is online</a>.</p>

<p>I am Canadian. I hold a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from the
<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>. I was born in Leningrad, RSFSR, and spent
my formative years in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
