By amping up the softest instances of a song to make them closer in volume to the loudest instances, you can create the perception of loudness. This process is called dynamic range compression and is routinely done (and over-done) by recording engineers to create ever-louder music, colloquially referred to as "The Loudness War". 

At first glance, this may sound like a theory devised by a crotchety old man in a rocking chair yelling at his loud teenaged neighbors to "turn the goddamned music down!" but The Echo Nest just proved that it's actually a thing.
