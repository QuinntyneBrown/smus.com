The web used to be "open by default". The key property that enabled
google in the 90's was that generally speaking, web content could be
read by machines. This was the default state -- developers didn't need
to do anything to make it happen.

Since then, we have moved from a declarative web to an imperative one,
where the web has evolved into a ubiquitous developer platform. Combine
this with the definite trend toward personalization - many companies
providing interesting content only behind ACL, only visible when logged
in - and you have the modern web.

As the web grows in complexity, JS-rich content gets harder and harder
to crawl, and prohibitively hard for anyone that's not a search engine.
In this world, what enables innovation for the little guys are APIs. The
problem with these, however is that they require work for the API
providers to implement. So the web is now largely "closed by default".

I'd love to bring us back to the "open by default" web, while retaining
the user experience benefits of thick clients. Ideas welcome :)
