Dan Tepfer on the interesting relationship between rhythm and pitch, at first glance completely distinct musical phenomena. The fascinating thing is that the two are actually quite related. Fundamentally, it's a question of frequency. Slow repetition (low frequency) is perceived as rhythm, while fast repetition (high frequency) is perceived as pitch, by apparently distinct subsystems. Quoth Dan:

> For slow things, our consciousness distinguishes individual events and interprets them as what we call “rhythm”, such as the child tapping on her knees. For very fast things (like when the taps get very close together), our consciousness isn’t fast enough to distinguish the individual events, and our pitch hearing kicks in, guided by those tiny hairs in our cochlea, each one specialized in resonating at a certain pitch.
