[Jake](https://twitter.com/jakek) used to get easily distracted by his smartphone:

> Maybe you can handle that temptation. Maybe you've got willpower. That's great for you, but for me, willpower alone didn't cut it. [...]
> Checking email, checking Twitter, checking news. Wondering if something interesting was happening anywhere in the world. Wondering if anybody was thinking about me.

Jake fixed his problem by doing three simple things:

1. Remove apps with a stream.
2. Disable email.
3. Disable the web browser.

I have the same problem. How about you?
