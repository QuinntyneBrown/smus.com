This site is powered by Lightning, a static blogging engine with a few
features I wanted but couldn't find in other similar projects:

- Incremental builds.
- Logical placement of article-specific assets.
- Fully decoupled content from output.

Today I packed it up into a consumable codebase. Unfortunately I haven't
had time for unit tests, so YMMV. Usage instructions and repository is
[on github][lightning].
