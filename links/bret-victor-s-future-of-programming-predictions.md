Another great performance from Bret Victor (circa 1973). Firstly, this
is probably the most succinct but complete argument for why Java should
not be the primary focus for undergrad Computer Science programs.

About two years ago, Alan Kay said that "the best way to predict the
future is to invent it". This talk is a great reminder that even
inventing a possible future, you're likely to be way off.
