    <p>Picking up where I left off <a href="/uist-2014">3 years ago</a> with this year's UIST
highlight reel. As expected, the research creatively applied interesting
principles, but many applications were adorably contrived. Also, I miss academia!</p>

  <a href='/notes/2017/a-respectful-truce/'><h1 class='title'>A respectful truce?</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>It's a fact that men greatly outnumber women in software engineering. As for
why, there is a fundamental disagreement between social constructivists and
evolutionary psychologists. </p>

<p>Constructivists say that it’s because of systematic oppression against women.
Boys in the 80s grew up with computers, learned programming and made life a
living hell for their female classmates in CS101. <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">Planet Money</a> has the
scoop. Evolutionary psychologists say that it’s because men and women have
evolutionarily caused <a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/08/10/the-google-memo-what-does-the-research-say-about-gender-differences/">differences in interests</a> and point to studies
indicating that progressive countries have larger gender representation gaps
because women are free to choose <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/">careers based on interest</a>. I find
it likely that both positions contribute in part to the gender representation
disparity. Compelling arguments can be made for and against both, and both are
rooted in academic disciplines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">that are dangerously squishy</a>. As a
result, I don’t think we currently have a good scientific way of determining
this.</p>

<p>So what; science, schmience! Followers of the evo psych and constructivism are
at war. One continuously pisses the other off with their inflamatory rhetoric.
It is true that white males are historically privileged, but hammering “white
male privelege” into their heads predictably puts white males into a defensive
stance. Similarly, discussing how evo psych means that women are less interested
and therefore less capable of software engineering will predictably annoy
females, especially those rightfully proud of their software engineering
prowess, and tired of dealing with similar allegations for their whole career.</p>

<p>I've spent way too much time reading and thinking about this lately, and it
saddens me to conclude that the wisest course of action is to avoid discussing
this topic entirely (oops, too late). Scott Aaronson, Sarah Constantin and
Stacey Jeffery propose a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3389">respectful truce</a> between the two camps.
Advocates of evolutionary psychology should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do everything they can to foster diversity, including by creating environments
  that are welcoming for women, and by supporting affirmative action, women-only
  scholarships and conferences, and other diversity policies and also agree
  never to talk in public about possible cognitive-science explanations for
  gender disparities in which careers people choose, or overlapping bell curves,
  or anything else potentially inflammatory."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, social constructivists should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>avoid libelling [white men] as misogynist monsters, who must be scaring all
  the women away with their inherently gross, icky, creepy, discriminatory
  brogrammer maleness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truce?</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/">short Web Audio book</a>, I covered the <code>BiquadFilterNode</code>, but didn't
have any sense for how it worked. As I sat down to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Machine-Hearing-Extracting-Meaning/dp/1107007534">Human and Machine
Hearing</a>, it became clear that I needed to catch up on some digital
filtering fundamentals.</p>

<p>What follows is an introduction to digital filters via <a href="http://explorabl.es/">explorable
explanation</a> I built to help myself better understand some DSP concepts.
The approach I took was to try to present the concept as visually and aurally as
possible, maximizing opportunities to build intuition. I learned a lot in the
process. Read on for a introduction, jump ahead to the <a href="https://borismus.github.io/filter-playground/">Filter Playground</a>,

  <a href='/notes/2017/the-end-of-endings/'><h1 class='title'>The end of endings</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Despite the obnoxious title, <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/07/15/popularity-addiction-thompson-alter/">this a16z podcast</a> was unusually insightful.</p>

<p>One big theme in the podcast can be summarized as an end of endings: a trend
away from one story with a coherent, finite arc, towards something neverending.
Amorphous TV shows like Lost, as well as Hollywood's discovery that a coherent
franchise like Star Wars can be milked for many more dollars are examples of
this. The stats backs it up: Hollywood moved from 10% of the hits of the 90s
being sequels to 50% today, as can be seen in the <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/">box office data</a>.
Looking at TV shows through the same lens, each show is a one hour long movie,
followed by tens of sequels. And successful franchises aim to immerse their fans
(especially kids) into their universe with figurines, games, lunch boxes, bed
sheets.</p>

<p>The end of endings also shows up in user interfaces, and is epitomized by the
infinite scroller. Millions of souls fixate on the next pretty picture, the next
baby picture, the next outrage. Entertainment that never ends!</p>

<p>This is interesting in the context of attention. In the realm of meditation, the
challenge is to focus on something mundane, like your breath. In the realm of
entertainment, the challenge is to snap out of an immersive world carefully
constructed to consume your attention for as long as possible.</p>

  <a href='/notes/2017/intelligence-aliens-and-self-improvement/'><h1 class='title'>Intelligence, aliens, and self-improvement</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>I recently enjoyed a podcast about intelligence, aliens and learning where Kevin
Kelly was interviewed by Sam Harris. Here are some things I liked about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kelly makes a great argument that with text we already have no way of knowing
what is true. We have to rely on the source. My fears of audio and video fake
news are reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>It's obvious that the world is changing quickly, which means lifelong learning
is necessary. One thing I haven't systematically understood is how I learn
best. How would you even figure that out?</p></li>
<li><p>Chimpanzees are amazing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A">short term spatial
memory</a>, and do better than
humans in these cognitive tasks on average.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, the best Chess players are human-computer hybrids. Harris claims
that computers alone will eventually be better than these hybrids, but 
his claim that "the ape will just be adding noise" is unsubstantiated.</p></li>
<li><p>About mid-way, the two discuss the analogy between AI and aliens. I haven't
thought of this either. But I wondered how salient that analogy was given that we
have a largely shared environment with whatever AIs we create. To the extent
that the AIs truly are alien, I wonder how much of a unifying force these
alien AIs could be for humanity. </p></li>
<li><p>I strongly agreed with Kelly when he says that building machine systems
enhances our self-understanding. Building VR rendering and head tracking
systems, you benefit from some human visual perception basics. Human
psychology is critical for building user interfaces. You need an understanding
of how human hearing works to build good lossy audio compression.</p></li>
<li><p>An interesting thought experiment that superscedes Asimov's laws of robotics:
what if we built AGIs that were terribly worried about what people think. Then
we reduce the machine menace problem to merely the evils of humanity. </p></li>
</ul>

  <a href='/notes/2017/convincing-the-inconvincible/'><h1 class='title'>Convincing the inconvincible</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>I highly recommend two <a href="http://loveandradio.org/2014/02/the-silver-dollar/">podcast</a> <a href="http://loveandradio.org/2017/02/how-to-argue/">episodes</a> on the theme "how to argue",
featuring Daryl Davis, <em>the</em> black friend of white supremacists. Mr. Davis is
remarkably lucid in dealing with very difficult issues, and presents great tips
for convincing the inconvincible. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gather your information. Understand their position as well as you do your
own. Expect to hear things you will disagree with and keep your cool. </p></li>
<li><p>Invite them. Have a conversation not a debate. Debates get people's guards
up. Instead seek to understand them. People want to be heard and speak their
mind freely without retaliation. </p></li>
<li><p>Look for commonality. You can find something in 5 minutes and then build on
it. Look to other issues. Politics? As you find more commonality the
differences matter less. </p></li>
<li><p>Talking is not fighting. When the talking stops the ground becomes fertile
for violence (cf. Sam Harris). The longer you talk the more commonalities you
can find. </p></li>
<li><p>Patience.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a good first impression. Be respectful. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't be condescending or insulting even when you hear things you don't like.
Expect opinions that are ridiculous and facts that are wrong. Keep cool. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't explain somebody else's movement. Let them explain it and address the
points that they themselves define. Let them finish and don't cut them off
even though you probably know a lot about their ideas already. </p></li>
</ol>

  <div class='body'>
    <p><a href="/viewpoint-tolerance-through-curiosity/">Last week</a> I ran a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">Climate metaquiz</a>, and 123 people responded.
The point of a metaquiz is to test how well political groups know the other
side, while questions on personal beliefs and knowledge about the climate are
secondary. Both the small sample size and potential sampling biases are
important caveats to keep in mind here. All that said, Republicans outperformed
Democrats on the factual part of the quiz, despite their low self-reported
self-confidence.  However, Democrats outperformed Republicans on the <em>metaquiz</em>
part, with Republicans tending to exaggerate levels of climate change-related
handwringing amongst Democrats, as well as their eagerness to exaggerate the
facts in the name of behavior change.</p>

    <p>Polarization isn't necessarily problematic. Strictly defined, it refers to the
divergence of political extremes. In fact, a wider variety of opinions may
actually be a <a href="https://ratedzed.wordpress.com/2017/05/20/the-biased-media/">good situation</a>. Things start to go south when a tribal
us-verus-them mentality takes over, giving rise to an uncharitable view of the
other side. This thinking is especially common among the <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-shouting-class.html">shouting
classes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those that disagree with me must be stupid, evil, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only is this incorrect, but adhering to this position is actively bad for
society. It prevents finding common ground and encourages wild policy swings as
power is transfered from one uncompromising faction to the next. The same facts
can generate different viewpoints, each deserving of a spot in the marketplace
of ideas, even if we personally disagree with them.</p>

<p>With <a href="/debaters-friendly-disagreement/">Debaters</a>, Antonio and I tried to bring people that disagree
together. Sadly most people don't want to converse with the other side whom
they perceive to be their mortal enemies. The problem must be approached more
obliquely, taking into account human nature. This post is about using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">quizzes
like this one</a> to lure people into learning more about the other side
by appealing to a powerful emotion: curiosity.</p>

  <a href='/notes/2017/remembering-my-personal-wiki/'><h1 class='title'>Remembering my personal wiki</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Before I started writing this blog, I used <a href="https://moinmo.in">MoinMoin</a> as a personal wiki.
It was self-hosted on a Linux box in my parents' basement. I used it for
everything: jotting down ideas, as a calendar, storing guitar tabs, tracking
workout routines, course planning, and personal finances. I wrote on the wiki
actively from about 2002 to about 2008. Here are some blasts from the past:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Lego fandom started to shift from into robotics. To be clear,
this is just a fancy way of saying that I was still <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Bartender/">playing</a> <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/CardDealer/">with</a>
<a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/VerticalCrossBeams/">legos</a> into my early twenties.</li>
<li>Origami interests also shifted into the <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/OrigamiSoftware/">digital realm</a>.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Network/">maintained a network</a> of about ten Linux boxes named after
<a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Aleph/">Hebrew</a> <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Zayin/">letters</a>. What a pain in the ass!</li>
<li>Wrote a few computer games, like this uninspired <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/ArcadeTank/">tank game</a>, and this
totally awesome <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Sponge/">pong variant</a> that was played inside a sphere.</li>
<li>Discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second system syndrome</a> when trying to rewrite <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Alienation/">a web based
RPG</a> I originally wrote in 2000.</li>
<li>Had some interesting, still relevant <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/GpsRpg/">ideas foreshadowing</a> Augmented
Reality gaming.</li>
<li>Catalogued delicious Japanese food in <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/JapaneseRestaurants/">Vancouver</a>.</li>
<li>Smashed a Palm Tungsten <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/TungstenDestruction/">with a hammer</a> out of frustration,
attempted to use a <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/TreoBluetoothHeadsets/">Bluetooth headset with my Treo</a> and dreamed of a
<a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/DreamGadget/">better gadget</a>.</li>
<li>Hoping to <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/MatrixWorkouts/">avoid the gym</a>, I got into <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Kettlebells/">kettlebells for fitness</a>,
and even thought about starting a <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Gireviki/">kettlebell community</a>.</li>
<li>Saved <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Guitar(2f)Gravedigger/">guitar</a> <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Guitar(2f)WildMountainThyme/">tabs</a> I played with the intention of
<a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/LibTab/">doing something techy</a> with them later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embarassing and endearing, <code>wiki.z3.ca</code> serves as a time capsule of my late
teens and early twenties. Je me souviens.</p>
