  <a href='/notes/2019/books-highlights-of-2019/'><h1 class='title'>Books highlights of 2019</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>I’ve been reading and summarizing for five years now (cue Ratatat). I’m not sure that it’s helped much with retention, but at the very least, having an easily searchable corpus of my book-related notes is worthwhile.</p>

<p>A decent year for fiction, I finally read <a href="/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino/">Invisible Cities</a>, which I enjoyed not viscerally, but more as an art piece. I liked <a href="/books/the-fiddler-is-a-good-woman/">The Fiddler is a Good Woman</a> for the author’s ability to retell the same sordid tale from multiple perspectives. <a href="http://localhost:5500/books/diamond-age-by-stephenson-audio/">Diamond Age</a> was a collection of incredible ideas and surprisingly relevant for my job. I also enjoyed <a href="/books/hyperion-by-dan-simmons-audio/">Hyperion</a>, especially Sol Weintraub’s tale, which touched me deeply. <a href="/books/the-fifth-season-by-n-k-jemisin/">The Fifth Season</a> was interesting, but I have some identitarian reservations. I think my overall fiction highlight was <a href="/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio/">Homer’s Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson</a>.</p>

<p>I read two non-fiction books which were a little too extreme for my tastes: <a href="/books/deschooling-society-by-ivan-illich">Deschooling Society</a>, which just read like an angry and ill considered screed and <a href="/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl/">Radical Markets</a>, which had some really interesting ideas, but presented as a whole seemed ridiculous. I really enjoyed <a href="/books/timefulness-by-marcia-bjornerud-audio/">Timefulness</a>, a whirlwind overview of geology, and <a href="/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/">Range</a>, an ode to generalists. The standout non-fiction for me was <a href="/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott/">Seeing Like a State</a>, which will continue to turn over in my mind for years to come. I listened to fewer history lectures than usual, but can wholeheartedly recommend <a href="/books/the-story-of-medieval-england-audio/">The Story of Medieval England</a>. Instead, I focused on parenting books, which are pretty bad as a genre. That said, <a href="/books/the-new-father/">The New Father</a> served as a worthwhile companion to skim during the first year of Eliana’s life, and <a href="/books/yes-brain-by-siegel-and-bryson/">Yes Brain</a> had practical suggestions for digesting mindfulness into something that small children might be able to understand.</p>

<p>I also begun a new long-term book summarization project, which is to digest <a href="">Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery</a>, and visualize it as a Civ-style tech tree. Hopefully I’ll have something to report on that front in 2020!</p>

    <p>I’m still using Instapaper for reading online things, although in 2020, my aim is to read articles (even) less, in favor of books.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>WebUSB bridges two amazing universes: the open web and the maker movement. Web pages can now talk directly to external hardware over USB, and it works on both mobile and desktop (at least in Chrome). There are a <a href="https://github.com/webusb/arduino">few basic samples</a> out there, but for my own edification, I wanted to get my hands dirty. I hooked up a Wii Nunchuck to an Arduino, and built a webpage to plot sensor readings in real-time. Here’s the resulting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmtltjk66w">video</a> and <a href="/webusb-arduino/#" title="https://github.com/borismus/sensor-streamer">code</a>.</p>

  <a href='/toddler-music-box'><h1 class='title'>Toddler’s First Music Box</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Toddler toys are stacked with blinking lights, loud attention seeking noises, and earworm songs. They are often made of plastic and sadly, feel cheap. My daughter deserves better! </p>

<p>So I set out to design her a perfect music box: an old concept infused with modern technology, without subjecting her to the hazards of screens. I wanted the box to play her favorite songs, be durable and portable, have long battery life, all while being a beautiful object. This is the result:</p>

  <a href='/zelda-lego'><h1 class='title'>Link's Awakening LEGO Mosaic</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>A parismonious use of pixels (160 x 114) and color (four-color greenscale) lends
itself super well to reproduction as a LEGO mosaic! LEGO has this amazing
service called
<a href="https://www.lego.com/page/static/pick-a-brick#shopxlink">Pick-a-Brick</a> where
you can buy spare parts that accidentally ended up in your vacuum cleaner's
dustbin. Or you can buy tiles and flats and make an awesome mosaic based on your
favorite 2-bit sprite. But how many tiles of each color do you need? Not to
worry, I've got you covered with this <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lego-mosaic/blob/master/count_colors.py">color counting
script</a>.
Fully assembled, two-bit LEGO Link makes an excellent coaster for the office
mug.</p>
