  <div class='body'>
    <p>I used twitter the most while working in developer relations, mainly sharing
articles about web development that I thought deserved more attention. My feed
consisted of engineers, developer advocates, and web standards folks I
respected, all of whom had something interesting to say. Twitter was my interest
graph, in contrast with Facebook, which was just a poor facsimile of real life
relationships.</p>

<p>As my career and interests shifted, so did the people I followed on twitter.
I started following VR engineers, machine learning researchers, philosophers
and psychologists. But more tweeps meant more tweets. Soon I had a <a href="https://twitter.com/borismus/lists/smartpeople">twitter
list</a> for people that I had reluctantly unfollowed. They had
interesting things to say, but said them too often.</p>

<p>Following someone on twitter is like having a direct line into their brain. If
they write about a subject you are passionate about, fantastic. If they have
broadly aligning interests, chances are they will turn you on to something neat,
or if you're lucky, life changing. Unfortunately, most of the time, twitter
brains are distracted, anxious, angry, or unhappy. Spastic tweet storms and
political ramblings deserve only one thing, a hearty unfollow.</p>

<p>Twitter's bad design decisions only compound the problem. In "Retweets Are
Trash", Alexis Madrigal <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/the-case-against-retweets/554078/">writes</a>, "When Twitter introduced a retweet
button, in 2009, suddenly one click could send a post careening through the
network. The automatic retweet took Twitter’s natural tendency for amplification
and cranked it up." Apparently it's not hard to globally disable retweets using
a <a href="https://medium.com/@Luca/how-to-turn-off-retweets-for-everyone-99dd835c10f8">crude hack</a>. Anecdotally, it seems to have made my feed a bit calmer.</p>

<p>A quick update on my <a href="http://smus.com/notes/2018/lynched-on-twitter/">white supremacist spam problem</a>. Time seems to
have sorted it out, and the remaining squawks have been muffled by twitter's
<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169398">quality filter</a>. I also tried using Mastodon. It was a calming
experience at first, but when I followed a few people and dug around a little
bit, I was dismayed to see most design choices mirroring twitter's. I caught up
on RSS feeds, which I really like. But the RSS ecosystem continues to die. Of
nearly five hundred RSS feeds in my OPML file, more than half are broken links.
Occasionally the links are fixed, causing my reader to choke on a year's worth
of articles from a blog whose existence I've long forgotten about.</p>

<p>I can't quite decide whether or not to use twitter again. I keep thinking that I
once got a lot out of my original use of the platform. If I do return, I'll be
making use of the @reply quality filter, fully disable retweets, and unfollow
more aggressively. Whether this makes twitter great again remains to be seen.</p>

  <a href='/notes/2018/lynched-on-twitter/'><h1 class='title'>Lynched on Twitter</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Last week, a <a href="https://twitter.com/borismus/status/798350680951910400">sarcastic twitter
reply</a> I posted two
years ago was picked up by an account called Blue Check Watch, looking for
verified twitter accounts disparaging white people. As a result, my account has
become inundated by a hybrid human-bot army of white supremacist trolls. Most
responses accused me of anti-white racism, completely missing what I thought was
obviously a sarcastic tone. Sadly, many of the attacks are really nasty and
ad-hominem. One user
<a href="https://twitter.com/CascadianDennis/status/1033190496456269824">posted</a> "Why do
people who say this always look like this?", alongside my twitter profile photo.
Others are
<a href="https://twitter.com/1CE1CEB4BY/status/1033197950703464448">explicitly</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/NationDixie/status/1033395244014944256">anti-semitic</a>
messages that do not bear repeating here. Ominously, I received an email from
Twitter informing me that they have investigated <strong>my tweet</strong>, flagged for violating
their TOS and "have not taken any action at this time."</p>

<p>Writing my snarky tweet two years ago, I was a bit uncertain whether it was
within the bounds of social acceptability. A white guy telling another
white guy that white guys are "the worst", was intended to poke a bit of fun at
the self-flaggelation associated with progressive politics. There is only so
much self-censorship one can do while still remaining authentic. In a surprising
twist, my tweet was offensive to a group I hadn't even thought about in a way I
could not have predicted, two years after the fact.</p>

<p>Twitter lynchings are not new, but it's different when it happens to you. It has
not had any serious consequences (yet?), and until it does, I will continue to
view this as a funny story, and not something truly traumatic, as it is often
framed in the press. Still, this experience serves as a good reminder of a few
points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Twitter's UI for threaded conversations is terrible, and hardly anyone of my
virtual lynch mob even bothered to look to the tweet I was responding to.</li>
<li>My tweet was five words, twenty four characters. It was meant to be pithy,
because that is how twitter works. But brief posts beget brief responses,
which is fine between friends, but not fine when the whole world is watching.</li>
<li>Relatedly, sarcasm is hard to convey in this situation. Only two responses
suggested that maybe I was being sarcastic, imploring my attackers, "Don't be
lazy."</li>
<li>The fact that tweets have no expiry date means anything you have ever posted
can be used against you in surprising ways. It took two years for my tweet to
be picked up. James Gunn's incriminating posts were ten years old. Social
norms change quickly, and this is one argument in favor of ephemerality.</li>
<li>On that same note, it seems that the white supremacy movement has really
embraced the internet over the last couple of years in some sick symbiosis
with the POTUS. At the same time, it's striking that the result of someone's
pathetic search for anti-white sentiment yielded such a lackluster example.</li>
<li>Despite a general willingness for my views to be challenged, I don't have
energy or desire to engage with this mob. I made no attempts to respond to
any of my attackers. They appear to be victims of confirmation bias, stupid
and/or malicious, and I have little faith that they will listen.</li>
<li>There are some really nasty people on the internet. If triggered, they will
sherlock your religion, your employer, your family, and try to hit you where
it hurts the most.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lynchings aside, I've been trying to use twitter less in favor of consuming and
producing longer form content, like books, blogs, and conversations. Given that
my account is currently being inundated with anti-semitic spam, I have very
little incentive to continue using the service. One thing that has been keeping
me on the platform is the potential reach I can get through 6K followers. I
should remember that in the grand scheme of things, this is a small number, 5
orders of magnitude less than the lovely POTUS. I shouldn't grow attached.</p>

<p>And so, just in time for my tenth twitter anniversary, it's time for me to make
some changes. At the very least, I'll be taking a long break.</p>

  <a href='/notes/2018/the-difficult-middle/'><h1 class='title'>The difficult middle</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Monism gives life meaning through a single all-encompassing doctrine. Examples
include some political ideologies, religions, and <a href="https://meaningness.com/non-theistic-eternalism">variants of
rationality</a>. History has not been kind to those that have
fervently followed such doctrines. But once you see flaws in Monism, it can be
tempting to decide that life has <a href="https://meaningness.com/extreme-examples-eternalism-and-nihilism">no meaning at all</a>, falling
into the trap of Nihilism.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WXdU3ef.gif" alt="Stuck" /></p>

<p>The choice between these two extremes is a false one. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/erGipespbbzdG5zYb/the-third-alternative">Rationalists know
this</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way">Buddhists know this</a>. Philosophers know
this too. David Chapman writes a <a href="https://meaningness.com/">whole blog</a> devoted to exploring
the space in between. But I have found <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html">Isaiah Berlin</a>'s synthesis to
be the most compelling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sobered by the 20th century’s failed utopias, [Berlin]
  argued for a more modest liberal pluralism that makes room for multiple,
  genuinely conflicting goods. Family and work, solidarity and autonomy, tradition
  and innovation are really valuable, and really in tension.  – <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now/554054/">Alison
  Gopnik</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this view, we are condemned to an eternal balancing act, sometimes peering
too far into the meaningless abyss, and other times relaxing too deeply into
meaningful certainty. On balance, I hope to end up in this difficult middle.</p>

possible to view these works as aspirational rather than cautionary. I generally

  <div class='body'>
    <p><a href="https://pessimists.co/">Pessimists archive</a> is a podcast that chronicles
pessimistic reactions to emerging technology as it was becoming mainstream.
Technology here is defined broadly, covering a broad range of topics: bikes,
coffee, pinball machines, vaccines, recorded music. The podcast is very
accessible, focused more on social and psychological issues and less on the tech
itself. </p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>The belief that <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_is_systematized_winning">"rationalists should win"</a> is widely held in the
rationalist community. So: does being a good rationalist actually help you win?
Certainly in some domains, like engineering and science, which focus on
quantification, systematization, and prediction. There, having a hyper-rational
mindset is clearly an advantage. As for winning at life, which I will take that
to mean leading to greater success in survival, evolution, and human
flourishing, I don't think rationality helps very much.</p>

    <p><a href="/web-audio-ml-features">Last time</a> we converted audio buffers into images. This time
we'll take these images and train a neural network using
<a href="https://deeplearnjs.org">deeplearn.js</a>. The result is <a href="https://google.github.io/web-audio-recognition/inference-demo/?model=yesno">a browser-based demo</a> that 
lets you speak a command ("yes" or "no"), and see the output of the classifier
in real-time, like this:</p>

<p><video src="/web-voice-command-recognition/inference-demo.mp4" autoplay muted loop type="video/mp4"
style="width: 100%"></p>

<p>Curious to play with it, see whether or not it recognizes <em>yay</em> or <em>nay</em> in
addition to <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>? <a href="https://google.github.io/web-audio-recognition/inference-demo/?model=yesno">Try it out live</a>. You will quickly see
that the performance is far from perfect. But that's ok with me: this example is
intended to be a reasonable starting point for doing all sorts of audio
recognition on the web. Now, let's dive into how this works.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>One of the first problems presented to students of deep learning is to classify
handwritten digits in the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners">MNIST dataset</a>. This was recently <a href="https://deeplearnjs.org/demos/model-builder/">ported to
the web</a> thanks to <a href="https://deeplearnjs.org">deeplearn.js</a>. The web version has
distinct educational advantages over the relatively dry TensorFlow tutorial.
You can immediately get a feeling for the model, and start building intuition
for what works and what doesn't. Let's preserve this interactivity, but change
domains to audio. This post sets the scene for the auditory equivalent of MNIST.
Rather than recognize handwritten digits, we will focus on recognizing spoken
commands. We'll do this by converting sounds like this:</p>

<p><audio src="/web-audio-ml-features/left.wav" controls></audio></p>

<p>Into images like this, called log-mel spectrograms, and in the <a href="/web-voice-command-recognition/">next post</a>,
feed these images into the same types of models that do handwriting recognition
so well:</p>

<p><img src="/web-audio-ml-features/final-log-mel-spectrogram.png" alt="Final log-mel spectrogram." /></p>

<p>The audio feature extraction technique I discuss here is generic enough to work
for all sorts of audio, not just human speech. The rest of the post explains
how. If you don't care and just want to <a href="https://github.com/google/web-audio-recognition/tree/master/audio-features">see the code</a>, or <a href="https://google.github.io/web-audio-recognition/audio-features/">play with some
