  <a href='/vr-views'><h1 class='title'>Embedding VR content on the web</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>During a two week trip to India, I took over 1000 shots, including photos,
videos and a few photospheres. A picture is worth one thousand words, but how
many pictures is a photosphere worth? We may never know, but I digress. My
favorite photosphere was of friends posing inside one of the turrets of the
Jaigur fort:</p>

<iframe class="vrview" width="100%" height="300px" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" src="//storage.googleapis.com/vrview/index.html?image=//smus.com/vr-views/india-photosphere-4096.jpg&preview=//smus.com/vr-views/india-photosphere-1024.jpg&is_stereo=false"></iframe>

<script>
function DeviceMotionSender(){if(!this.isIOS_()){return}window.addEventListener("devicemotion",this.onDeviceMotion_.bind(this),false);this.iframes=document.querySelectorAll("iframe.vrview")}DeviceMotionSender.prototype.onDeviceMotion_=function(e){var message={type:"DeviceMotion",deviceMotionEvent:this.cloneDeviceMotionEvent_(e)};for(var i=0;i<this.iframes.length;i++){var iframe=this.iframes[i];var iframeWindow=iframe.contentWindow;if(this.isCrossDomainIframe_(iframe)){iframeWindow.postMessage(message,"*")}}};DeviceMotionSender.prototype.cloneDeviceMotionEvent_=function(e){return{acceleration:{x:e.acceleration.x,y:e.acceleration.y,z:e.acceleration.z},accelerationIncludingGravity:{x:e.accelerationIncludingGravity.x,y:e.accelerationIncludingGravity.y,z:e.accelerationIncludingGravity.z},rotationRate:{alpha:e.rotationRate.alpha,beta:e.rotationRate.beta,gamma:e.rotationRate.gamma},interval:e.interval}};DeviceMotionSender.prototype.isIOS_=function(){return/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent)&&!window.MSStream};DeviceMotionSender.prototype.isCrossDomainIframe_=function(iframe){var html=null;try{var doc=iframe.contentDocument||iframe.contentWindow.document;html=doc.body.innerHTML}catch(err){}return html===null};var dms=new DeviceMotionSender;
</script>

<p>I captured this using the photosphere camera which ships with Android. It's
embedded into my blog using <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/vrview">VR View</a>, which <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/introducing-vr-view-embed-immersive.html">launched
today</a>. The embed above lets you include an interactive photosphere
right in your website, which is especially fun on a mobile device, where the
image reacts directly to your phone's movements. You can view it in full screen
mode, and even in Cardboard mode if you view on a mobile device.</p>

<p>But you know what's cooler than a photosphere? A stereo photosphere! And
luckily, you can capture stereo photospheres using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.cyclops&amp;hl=en">Cardboard Camera</a>, and
then use VR Views to <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/vrview/examples/pano/index.html">embed them too</a>. You can even embed mono or
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/vrview/examples/video/index.html">stereo videos</a>. Check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/vrview">the docs</a> for more info. Eager
to hear what you think!</p>

  <a href='/simulating-wealth-inequality'><h1 class='title'>Simulating wealth inequality</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Economic inequality is rising in the US. A viral video from several years ago
made this abundantly clear:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM"><img src="/simulating-wealth-inequality/video_small.jpg" alt="Wealth inequality in U.S." /></a></p>

<p>The gap between desire, expectation and reality is truly shocking, and inspired
me to learn more. In particular, whether or not inequality is actually a big
problem, and then to better understand issues that the video above did not
address:</p>

<ol>
<li>How did the US become so economically unequal?</li>
<li>How can this inequality be reduced?</li>
</ol>

<p>My answers come in the form of simple simulations. For example, the following
simulation has two agents with different salaries, but the same spending habits.
You can <a href="http://borismus.github.io/inequality-simulator/?model=1-world-income-ineq-doesnt-lead-to-wealth-ineq.js">play with it</a> yourself!</p>

<p><a href="http://borismus.github.io/inequality-simulator/?model=1-world-income-ineq-doesnt-lead-to-wealth-ineq.js">
<video src="/simulating-wealth-inequality/simulator.mp4" autoplay loop style="width: 100%"></video>
</a></p>

<p>In the first part of this post, I try to provide some background on economic
inequality: how to measure it, various forms of it, and whether or not it's a
problem.  In the last part, I try to explain how we got to the status quo, and
how inequality can potentially be reduced. Rather than just making claims, I use
simulations like the one above to defend my claims. This way, you can see more
clearly where I'm coming from, and if you disagree, you can <a href="http://github.com/borismus/inequality-simulator">make your own
simulation</a> with better assumptions.</p>

  <a href='/sensor-fusion-prediction-webvr'><h1 class='title'>Sensor fusion and motion prediction</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>A major technical challenge for VR is to make head tracking as good as possible.
The metric that matters is called <strong>motion-to-photon latency</strong>. For mobile VR
purposes, this is the time that it takes for a user's head rotation to be fully
reflected in the rendered content.</p>

<p><img src="/sensor-fusion-prediction-webvr/latency-chain.jpg" alt="Motion to photon pipeline" /></p>

<p>The simplest way to get up-and-running with head tracking on the web today is
to use the <code>deviceorientation</code> events, which are generally well supported across
most browsers. However, this approach suffers from several drawbacks which can
be remedied by implementing our own sensor fusion. We can do even better by
predicting head orientation from the gyroscope.</p>

<p>I'll dig into these techniques and their open web implementations.  Everything
discussed in this post is implemented and available open source as part of the
<a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill">WebVR Polyfill</a> project. If you want to skip ahead, check out
the <a href="http://borismus.github.io/webvr-boilerplate/">latest head tracker</a> in action, and play around with this <a href="http://borismus.github.io/webvr-polyfill/fusion/sensors.html">motion
sensor visualizer</a>.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>Despite free access to information via the Internet and an increasingly global
world, people still seem to have all sorts of divergent ideas about how the world
works. For example, did you know that eating hot bread and pastries is
incredibly unhealthy? Indeed, it can often even lead to complete bowel
obstruction! I learned this fact as a kid, while growing up in the Soviet Union.
Understandably, I have been very careful to avoid eating hot baked goods.
That is, until recently, when my American girlfriend questioned the validity of my
belief and I began to harbor some doubts. I decided to check if it was actually
true, and asked Google. The results were very clear: I had fallen prey to an old
wives tale. My worldview, shattered.</p>

<p>Incredulous, I searched for the same thing in Russian and arrived at the
opposite conclusion. "What's up with that?" I thought, and wrote this post.</p>

    <p>I recently returned from ISWC 2015, where I presented the <a href="/magnetic-input-mobile-vr/">Cardboard
Magnet</a> paper. In addition to seeing old friends,
meeting new ones, and being inspired by some interesting research, it was an
excellent excuse to visit Osaka, Japan! This year, ISWC was co-located with
UbiComp, and the combined conference had four tracks. This post is by no means
exhaustive, just some of the more interesting work I got a chance to see.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>It's been over three years since the design of this site has been
updated. Time to change that!</p>

<p><img src="/design-v5/0days.jpg" class="floatright"/></p>

<p>This is the fifth revision of this site's design. Looking over <a href="/redesign-2012">previous
designs</a>, I've been happier with minimal designs,
especially <a href="/redesign-2012/v2.png">this one</a> from 2012. I was inspired
by many excellent designs such as <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">Butterick's Practical
Typography</a>,
<a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">Teehan+Lax</a>, <a href="http://www.erikjohanssonphoto.com/">Erik
Johansson</a>,
<a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/death-to-typewriters-9b7712847639">Medium</a>
and <a href="http://frankchimero.com/writing/other-halves">Frank Chimero</a>.</p>

<p>The new design is visually cleaner. I <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">use
flexbox</a> in many places, which makes
the CSS far more intuitive. The responsive parts are very simple,
consisting of just ten CSS declarations.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>Last summer I visited Austria, the capital of classical music. I had the
pleasure of hearing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespro_della_Beata_Vergine">Vespers of 1610</a> in the great
<a href="http://goo.gl/e3WBB2">Salzburger Dom (photosphere)</a>. The most memorable part of
the piece was that the soloists moved between movements, so their voices
and instruments emanated from surprising parts of the great hall.
Inspired, I returned to the west coast and eventually came around to
building a spatial audio prototypes like this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://borismus.github.io/moving-music"><img src="/spatial-audio-web-vr/collage_small.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a demo" /></a></p>

<p>Spatial audio is an important part of any good VR experience, since the
more senses we simulate, the more compelling it feels to our sense
fusing mind. WebVR, WebGL, and WebAudio all act as complementary specs
to enable this necessary experience. As you would expect, because it
uses the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate</a>, this demo can be viewed on
mobile, desktop, in Cardboard or an Oculus Rift. In all cases, you will
need headphones :)</p>

  <a href='/responsive-vr'><h1 class='title'>Responsive WebVR, headset optional</h1></a>

    <p>VR on the web threatens to cleave the web platform in twain, like mobile
did before it. The solution then and the solution now is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web
Design</a>, which websites to scale well for all form factors.
Similarly, for VR to succeed on the web, we need to figure out how to
make VR experiences that work both in any VR headset, and also without a
VR headset at all.</p>

<p><img src="/responsive-vr/hmds.png" alt="Various head mounted displays." /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate</a> is a new starting point for building
responsive web VR experiences that work on popular VR headsets and
degrace gracefully on other platforms. Check out a couple of demos, <a href="http://borismus.github.io/webvr-boilerplate/">a
simple one</a> and one <a href="http://borismus.github.io/sechelt">ported from MozVR</a>.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>Sensors found in smartphones define the mobile experience. GPS and the
magnetometer enable the fluid experience of maps; motion sensing enables
activity recognition and games, and of course the camera and microphone
allow whole categories of rich media applications. Beyond these now
obvious examples, sensors can also enable clever inventions, such as
<a href="http://www.cycloramic.com/">Cycloramic</a>, which used the vibrator motor in iPhones (4 and 5) to
rotate the phone and take a panorama, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.pushup.pro">pushup counters</a> which
use the proximity sensor to count repetitions, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carrotpop.www.smth">Send Me To
Heaven</a>, which uses the accelerometer to determine flight time of
a phone thrown vertically as high as possible. I've had some experience
using and abusing sensors too, most recently for the <a href="http://smus.com/talk/2014/io14/">Cardboard magnet
button</a>.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5775qwORk4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>However, over the last couple of years, I've had to step away from the
web as a development platform, in part because of the poor state of
sensor APIs.  In this post, I will describe some of the problems, take a
look at sensor APIs on iOS and Android, and suggest a solution in the
spirit of the <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">extensible web manifesto</a>.</p>
