    <p>Several books, movies, and articles have helped to shape my opinions on Virtual
Reality. I've was initially surprised by some former colleagues that it is
possible to view these works as aspirational rather than cautionary. I generally
prefer the dystopian interpretation. </p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p><a href="https://pessimists.co/">Pessimists archive</a> is a podcast that chronicles
pessimistic reactions to emerging technology as it was becoming mainstream.
Technology here is defined broadly, covering a broad range of topics: bikes,
coffee, pinball machines, vaccines, recorded music. The podcast is very
accessible, focused more on social and psychological issues and less on the tech
itself. </p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>The belief that <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_is_systematized_winning">"rationalists should win"</a> is widely held in the
rationalist community. So: does being a good rationalist actually help you win?
Certainly in some domains, like engineering and science, which focus on
quantification, systematization, and prediction. There, having a hyper-rational
mindset is clearly an advantage. As for winning at life, which I will take that
to mean leading to greater success in survival, evolution, and human
flourishing, I don't think rationality helps very much.</p>

    <p><a href="/web-audio-ml-features">Last time</a> we converted audio buffers into images. This time
we'll take these images and train a neural network using
<a href="https://deeplearnjs.org">deeplearn.js</a>. The result is <a href="https://google.github.io/web-audio-recognition/inference-demo/?model=yesno">a browser-based demo</a> that 
lets you speak a command ("yes" or "no"), and see the output of the classifier
in real-time, like this:</p>

<p><video src="/web-voice-command-recognition/inference-demo.mp4" autoplay muted loop type="video/mp4"
style="width: 100%"></p>

<p>Curious to play with it, see whether or not it recognizes <em>yay</em> or <em>nay</em> in
addition to <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>? <a href="https://google.github.io/web-audio-recognition/inference-demo/?model=yesno">Try it out live</a>. You will quickly see
that the performance is far from perfect. But that's ok with me: this example is
intended to be a reasonable starting point for doing all sorts of audio
recognition on the web. Now, let's dive into how this works.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>One of the first problems presented to students of deep learning is to classify
handwritten digits in the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners">MNIST dataset</a>. This was recently <a href="https://deeplearnjs.org/demos/model-builder/">ported to
the web</a> thanks to <a href="https://deeplearnjs.org">deeplearn.js</a>. The web version has
distinct educational advantages over the relatively dry TensorFlow tutorial.
You can immediately get a feeling for the model, and start building intuition
for what works and what doesn't. Let's preserve this interactivity, but change
domains to audio. This post sets the scene for the auditory equivalent of MNIST.
Rather than recognize handwritten digits, we will focus on recognizing spoken
commands. We'll do this by converting sounds like this:</p>

<p><audio src="/web-audio-ml-features/left.wav" controls></audio></p>

<p>Into images like this, called log-mel spectrograms, and in the <a href="/web-voice-command-recognition/">next post</a>,
feed these images into the same types of models that do handwriting recognition
so well:</p>

<p><img src="/web-audio-ml-features/final-log-mel-spectrogram.png" alt="Final log-mel spectrogram." /></p>

<p>The audio feature extraction technique I discuss here is generic enough to work
for all sorts of audio, not just human speech. The rest of the post explains
how. If you don't care and just want to <a href="https://github.com/google/web-audio-recognition/tree/master/audio-features">see the code</a>, or <a href="https://google.github.io/web-audio-recognition/audio-features/">play with some
live demos</a>, be my guest!</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/">short Web Audio book</a>, I covered the <code>BiquadFilterNode</code>, but didn't
have any sense for how it worked. As I sat down to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Machine-Hearing-Extracting-Meaning/dp/1107007534">Human and Machine
Hearing</a>, it became clear that I needed to catch up on some digital
filtering fundamentals.</p>

<p>What follows is an introduction to digital filters via <a href="http://explorabl.es/">explorable
explanation</a> I built to help myself better understand some DSP concepts.
The approach I took was to try to present the concept as visually and aurally as
possible, maximizing opportunities to build intuition. I learned a lot in the
process. Read on for a introduction, jump ahead to the <a href="https://borismus.github.io/filter-playground/">Filter Playground</a>,

  <a href='/notes/2017/the-end-of-endings/'><h1 class='title'>The end of endings</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Despite the obnoxious title, <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/07/15/popularity-addiction-thompson-alter/">this a16z podcast</a> was unusually insightful.</p>

<p>One big theme in the podcast can be summarized as an end of endings: a trend
away from one story with a coherent, finite arc, towards something neverending.
Amorphous TV shows like Lost, as well as Hollywood's discovery that a coherent
franchise like Star Wars can be milked for many more dollars are examples of
this. The stats backs it up: Hollywood moved from 10% of the hits of the 90s
being sequels to 50% today, as can be seen in the <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/">box office data</a>.
Looking at TV shows through the same lens, each show is a one hour long movie,
followed by tens of sequels. And successful franchises aim to immerse their fans
(especially kids) into their universe with figurines, games, lunch boxes, bed
sheets.</p>

<p>The end of endings also shows up in user interfaces, and is epitomized by the
infinite scroller. Millions of souls fixate on the next pretty picture, the next
baby picture, the next outrage. Entertainment that never ends!</p>

<p>This is interesting in the context of attention. In the realm of meditation, the
challenge is to focus on something mundane, like your breath. In the realm of
entertainment, the challenge is to snap out of an immersive world carefully
constructed to consume your attention for as long as possible.</p>
