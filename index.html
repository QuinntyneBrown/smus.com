<p>In my <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/">short Web Audio book</a>, I covered the <code>BiquadFilterNode</code>, but didn't
have any sense for how it worked. As I sat down to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Human-Machine-Hearing-Extracting-Meaning/dp/1107007534">Human and Machine
Hearing</a>, it became clear that I needed to catch up on some digital
filtering fundamentals.</p>

<p>What follows is an introduction to digital filters via <a href="http://explorabl.es/">explorable
explanation</a> I built to help myself better understand some DSP concepts.
The approach I took was to try to present the concept as visually and aurally as
possible, maximizing opportunities to build intuition. I learned a lot in the
process. Read on for a introduction, jump ahead to the <a href="https://borismus.github.io/filter-playground/">Filter Playground</a>,

  <div class='body'>
    <p><a href="/viewpoint-tolerance-through-curiosity/">Last week</a> I ran a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">Climate metaquiz</a>, and 123 people responded.
The point of a metaquiz is to test how well political groups know the other
side, while questions on personal beliefs and knowledge about the climate are
secondary. Both the small sample size and potential sampling biases are
important caveats to keep in mind here. All that said, Republicans outperformed
Democrats on the factual part of the quiz, despite their low self-reported
self-confidence.  However, Democrats outperformed Republicans on the <em>metaquiz</em>
part, with Republicans tending to exaggerate levels of climate change-related
handwringing amongst Democrats, as well as their eagerness to exaggerate the
facts in the name of behavior change.</p>

    <p>Polarization isn't necessarily problematic. Strictly defined, it refers to the
divergence of political extremes. In fact, a wider variety of opinions may
actually be a <a href="https://ratedzed.wordpress.com/2017/05/20/the-biased-media/">good situation</a>. Things start to go south when a tribal
us-verus-them mentality takes over, giving rise to an uncharitable view of the
other side. This thinking is especially common among the <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-shouting-class.html">shouting
classes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those that disagree with me must be stupid, evil, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only is this incorrect, but adhering to this position is actively bad for
society. It prevents finding common ground and encourages wild policy swings as
power is transfered from one uncompromising faction to the next. The same facts
can generate different viewpoints, each deserving of a spot in the marketplace
of ideas, even if we personally disagree with them.</p>

<p>With <a href="/debaters-friendly-disagreement/">Debaters</a>, Antonio and I tried to bring people that disagree
together. Sadly most people don't want to converse with the other side whom
they perceive to be their mortal enemies. The problem must be approached more
obliquely, taking into account human nature. This post is about using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">quizzes
like this one</a> to lure people into learning more about the other side
by appealing to a powerful emotion: curiosity.</p>

<p>As technological progress plows forward, human nature is unchanged. We each look
at the world through our own lens. In a previous post, I found that <a href="/hot-bread-delicious-deadly/">translating
a query between English and Russian greatly determines search results</a>.
In the same way that language matters, so do religious views, culture, political
leanings, and much more. Here's a recent example highlighting a news
source-based lens on the same topic (Nancy Pelosi and Russia):</p>

<p>Humanity has always been divided, and in hindsight, the unifying promise of the
internet was a techno-utopian dream. By shrinking the world into a "global
village" (famously coined by communication theorist <a href="http://www.marshallmcluhan.com/biography/">Marshall McLuhan</a>)
we have balkanized into increasingly specialized sub-cultures and increased
cross-cultural conflicts. More recently, personalized search results, curated
social network feeds only serve to deepen the divide.</p>

<p><a href="https://debate.rs/">Debaters</a> is a new side project which aims to bring you and someone
with an opposing view into a private, friendly, anonymous conversation. It's
still in development, but I want to share it with you both as a milestone and
to get early feedback.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>News reporting suffers from two major issues I'd like to tackle. The first is a
bias towards negative, emotionally laden events. The second is the difficulty of
capturing information about gradual changes.</p>

<p>These two deficiencies distort our perception. They make it easy for demagogues
to claim that the world has gone to shit. The data tells a different story, as
the late <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen">Hans Rosling</a> was fond of reminding us. My hypothesis is that
if base rates were provided in a compelling way alongside news stories (or even
headlines), the public would be better informed. The challenges are many: first,
getting and analyzing the data, but even more important, presenting it in a
reasonable way.</p>

<p>In this post, let's explore what that would entail, from data collection, to
analysis, to visualization. We'll go through a couple of examples.</p>

  <a href='/making-better-decisions'><h1 class='title'>Tools for making better decisions</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>In a famous letter dating back to 1772, Benjamin Franklin described how he made
decisions to a friend who was facing a dilemma. Franklin's method involved
enumerating pros and cons of an argument, and then attempting to weigh one
against the other to ultimately decide which of the two possibilities to pursue.
Franklin wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My way is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns; writing
  over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then, during three or four days
  consideration, I put down under the different heads short hints of the different
  motives, ... I endeavor to estimate their respective weights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post attempts to modernize Franklin's method to attempt to overcome some of
its shortcomings. Once we have gathered our thoughts in one place using this
spreadsheet format, we can, with the help of others or using (aspirational) AI,
assist the decision maker to help them combat common mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing
  events, issues, and characters in the world outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many ways for news to be uninformative or even outright misleading.
Two trends in particular have received a lot of attention recently. The first is
social recommendation systems and selective unfollowing, which creates a
reality-distorting echo chamber. The second is fake news, which sure is in vogue
these days, and is obviously a problem that we should tackle.</p>

<p>This post is about a different trend: <a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/801893793540796416">real news presented with misleading
frequency</a>. The issue at stake is the media's ability to inform its readers
and serve the public interest.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/googlevr/vrview">VR View</a> was just updated to version 2! This release includes some nice
new features, the main one of which is a JavaScript API. This allows VR Views to
be much more interactive. You can now load new content dynamically, play and
pause videos, and add hotspots that link from one piece of 360 imagery to
another. Here's a simple auto-advancing 360 slideshow showing some of my recent
escapes around Seattle...</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>Back in June, I gave Trump a coldhearted 55% chance of winning the 2016 US
election. You don't have to believe me, since I recorded it in my
<code>Predictions.md</code> file, and never on <a href="http://gjopen.com">gjopen.com</a>, where it
belongs. My assessment was mostly based on anecdotal observations that recent,
related polls have been terribly wrong. Brexit and then Trump's surprise
Republican nomination both came as a complete surprise to experts from all
sides.</p>

<p>But, despite my dire predictions, it somehow didn't <em>feel</em> that I could be right
on the eve of the election. When the final result was revealed, I was just as
disturbed as everyone else. In retrospect, I attribute my "successful"
prediction mostly to luck combined with my apparently contrarian tendencies,
rather than to skill. Nearly a week after the announcement of President Trump,
I'm still processing the verdict. Two big questions loom: 1) Why did he win?,
and 2) Why didn't we see it coming?</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>What would the web look like if there were no scrollbars, no mouse cursors, and
no clickable links? That's what VR is like today. On one hand, this is great!
Developers are completely free to build however they want, leading to a lot of
interesting experiments. On the other hand, it takes a lot of engineering effort
to just get basic interactions up and running. Furthermore, it lacks
consistency. The alluring promise of being able to navigate from world to world
may be diluted by the frustration of having to rediscover new interaction
paradigms every time.</p>

<p>While sane interaction defaults are badly needed, baking them into the platform
violates principles of the <a href="https://github.com/extensibleweb/manifesto">Extensible Web</a>. With that in mind, I
implemented a basic Ray-based interaction library called <a href="https://github.com/borismus/ray-input">RayInput</a>, which
provides reasonable defaults for interacting with 3D objects in and outside of
VR. Here's what the interaction looks like on various platforms:</p>
