  <meta name="description" content=" I read Godel Escher Bach many years ago and really enjoyed it at the time. When I got my hands on this book, I was excited to read a late Doug Hofstadter work. To my surprise, by the end of Chapter 3, I was done with it. This book had none of the variety of its predecessor, and not much in terms of new ideas (as far as I can remember). I competely agreed with a goodreads review of it, courtesy of  Zach .     Conceptually, I guess you could say, I enjoyed it, but the presentation - the language of the author, the over-long format, and the strange mixture of hard math and elementary philosophy - diminished and diluted the content to the point that it was barely worth reading. The first problem is Hofstadter’s “aww shucks” Uncle Fluffy writing style. His language is so steeped in a fireside chat mentality that the meat of his ideas is completely devoured by his good-natured cleverness.      The Hedgehog and the Fox (4/5) - September 2016     The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing. -- Archilochus      According to Isaiah Berlin, Tolstoy is a natural fox who wanted to be a hedgehog. IB suggests that Tolstoy was too broad minded to be able to fully embrace a single doctrine, which could satisfactorily explain how the world works:     Any comforting theory which attempted to collect, relate, 'synthesize' reveal hidden substrata and concealed inner connections, which, though not apparent to the naked eye, nevertheless guaranteed the unity of all things... [Tolstoy] exploded without difficulty.      At the same time, Tolstoy wanted to be able to find some Einsteinian unified theory of everything (TOE), but was too talented as a critic to be able to do so.     What oppressed Tolstoy most was his lack of positive convictions; and that famous passage in Anna Karenina in which Levin's brother tells him that he- Levin- has no positive beliefs.      This division within himself caused him great pain at the end of his life.    As you can see, the writing here is not flowery, but rather complex and requires a high degree of attention. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I lacked given the circumstances of moving to Seattle.    This short book / essay was supposedly intended as a joke (an elaborate one, at 90 pages). Part of the fun is classifying people into animals, for example, here's IB's take:      Foxes: Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin, Shakespeare, Balzac and Joyce   Hedgehogs: Dante, Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Neitzsche, Ibsen and Proust      My conclusion is that Foxes &gt; Hedgehogs. The world really is complex, and a simple unified theory seems very unlikely. Also, I'll have to read more IB, in less turbulent circumstances. And more Tolstoy!    Sapiens (5/5) - September 2016    Yuval Noah Harari presents an outside view of humanity, from the perspective of a complete outsider, an alien with no particular interest in the human species. This is fascinating.    The scope of the book is very broad and often high level, starting with physics and chemistry 13.5 billion years ago at the dawn of the universe. Then, he turns to biology, which begins 3.8 billion years ago on earth, and finally to history and the cognitive revolution which starts about 70,000 years ago. Since then, 12,000 years ago, we had agriculture, which sped up the cognitive revolution. More recently, 500 years ago, the scientific revolution really turned it up a notch. The orders of magnitude of difference are appropriately humbling.    I liked the distinction between objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. The latter meaning something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.    Also striking was Harari's disdain for the agricultural revolution. He claims that it made most people worse off. The general point being that "history's choices are not made for the benefit of humans".    Another major theme is the unification of humankind, which compounds inter-subjective effects since societies grow bigger and bigger. Over time, cultures coalesce and form bigger and more complex civilisations. Even though today's civilizations seem to be clashing, they actually agree on many things, for example money. "For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers, and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance."    On religion, Harari has insights as well:     So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe - and He's evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.      Also, interestingly, he considers most "isms" to be religions. And this leads to interesting analyses. Harari delves deeply into humanism which he breaks down into three kinds:      Liberal humanism: that 'humanity' is a quality of individual humans, and that the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct.   Socialist humanism: hold as sacred not the inner voice of each individual, but the species Homo sapiens as a whole.   Evolutionary humanism: humankind is not something universal and eternal, but rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate.      The latter has a long connection to Nazism, but Harari suggests (and I agree) that modern biology is really pushing us back into that vein.    On the scientific revolution, Harari echoes the rational sentiment of accepting ignorance. As soon as you truly accept that you do not know, you leave the door open to new insights.     The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.      Overall, very worth a read (or listen, as I did).    How to actually change your mind by Eliezer Yudkowsky (4/5) - August 2016    Technically the second book in a giant epic entitled "Rationality: From AI to Zombies". The author is a well known rationalist and active member/founder of lesswrong.org, Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), etc.    Essentially, this is a series of essays written and published as "The sequences", around 2009. They are loosely related and cover a wide array of topics, many of them highlighting irrational modes of thought. Much of the work focuses on biases central to behavioral economics, focusing on Kahneman-style results. But the author goes beyond that, and also introduces a lot of opinion for how a rationalist should behave. At the same time, there is a tendency to be incredibly nerdy, which is alternatingly endearing and borderline autistic. I found myself asking the question: if one becomes a purely rational agent, isn't a computer strictly better? On the path to rationality, what aspects of humanity is worth preserving?    Here's some new stuff I learned. A fair amount of the book covers behavioral economics concepts that I read about already in TF&amp;S.    Litanies    Aumann’s Agreement Theorem suggests that no two rationalists can agree to disagree, given that they have the same information.    Litany of  Gendlin :     What is true is already so. Owning up to it doesn't make it worse. Not being open about it doesn't make it go away. And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with. Anything untrue isn't there to be lived. People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.      Litany of  Tarski :     If the box contains a diamond, I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond; If the box does not contain a diamond, I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond; Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.      Against black and white thinking    Yudkowsky is especially effective in his attacks on binary thinking. For example, on partisanship:     Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side, otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back - providing aid and comfort to the enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides of an issue in their professional life as scientists can suddenly turn into slogan-chanting zombies when there's a Blue or Green position on an issue.      On the tendency and fallacy in binary thought:     There is a natural tendency to treat discussion as a form of combat, an extension of war, a sport; and in sports you only need to keep track of how many points have been scored by each team. There are only two sides, and every point scored against one side is a point in favor of the other. Everyone in the audience keeps a mental running count of how many points each speaker scores against the other. At the end of the debate, the speaker who has scored more points is, obviously, the winner; so everything that speaker says must be true, and everything the loser says must be wrong.      The horns effect - all negative qualities correlate:     Stalin also believed that 2 + 2 = 4. Yet if you defend any statement made by Stalin, even “2 + 2 = 4,” people will see only that you are agreeing with stalin and you must be on his side.      And a very nice summary of a better way of thinking:     Not all arguments reduce to mere up or down. Lady Rationality carries a notebook, wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side.      Real belief vs. belief in belief:     Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus “wanting to write.” Mark Twain said: “A classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read.” Criticizing yourself from a sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, so that you’ll be able to say afterward that your faith is not blind. This is not the same as wanting to investigate.      Assume your interlocutor is good    "To argue against an idea honestly, you should argue against the best arguments of the strongest advocates". This, and the closely related concept of the principle of charity aka Steelmanning (the opposite of strawmanning), which I heard from a Sam Harris interview, sent me on a long reading tangent of arguments  for  and  against . Insightful tidbit from that last link:     First, seek to understand the actual viewpoints people you disagree with are actually advocating. Second, seek out intelligent and well-informed advocates of viewpoints you disagree with. You don’t have to make up what your opponents believe! As it happens, you have many smart opponents! Third, whenever possible, try to switch conversations from a debate focus to a collaborative truth-seeking focus.      Back to Big Yud. Some wisdom on focusing on the argument, not on the person:     Someone once said "Not all conservatives are stupid, but most stupid people are conservatives". If you cannot place yourself in a state of mind where this statement, true or false, seems completely irrelevant as a critique of conservatism, you are not ready to think rationally about politics.      A variation on the  reasonable person principle  (harkens back to my time at CMU).     To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange, mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being in. [...] Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with themselves as the villains.      Deciding which side to argue    Great distinction between rationality and rationalization. Very related to Haidt's position that beliefs are intuitive but their defence is rational. But Haidt makes no distinction like this. Would love to hear his thoughts on it.     Rationality is not for winning debates, it is for deciding which side to join. If you’ve already decided which side to argue for, the work of rationality is done within you, whether well or poorly. But how can you, yourself, decide which side to argue?      Eliezer suggests enumerating the evidence: "Lady Rationality carries a notebook, wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side". Here's how to construct an honest ultrarational argument for a particular political candidate:      Gather all evidence about the different candidates   Make a checklist which you will use to decide which candidate is best   Process the checklist   Go to the winning candidate   Offer to become their campaign manager   Use the checklist as the campaign literature      The future is hard to predict    Herd instinct in venture capitalism:     The majority of venture capitalists at any given time are all chasing the same Revolutionary Innovation, and it’s the Revolutionary Innovation that IPO’d six months ago. This is an especially crushing observation in venture capital, because there’s a direct economic motive to not follow the herd.      And what to do about it. DFJ (a VC) has a rule  favoring a passionate minority  to outweigh a negative majority.  This also reminds me of the  Tenth Man Rule .     Only two partners need to agree in order to fund any startup up to $1.5 million. And if all the partners agree that something sounds like a good idea, they won’t do it.      Movies and books have a huge effect on the human psyche. This will probably compound with more immersive storytelling mediums:     So far as I can tell, few movie viewers act as if they have directly observed Earth’s future. [...] But those who commit the fallacy seem to act as if they had seen the movie events occurring on some other planet; not Earth, but somewhere similar to Earth.      Predicting numbers is especially difficult:     I observe that many futuristic predictions are, likewise, best considered as attitude expressions. Take the question, “How long will it be until we have human-level AI?” The responses I’ve seen to this are all over the map.      Avoid having THE Great Idea and get granular and specific    Avoiding partisanship by focusing on the minimum viable argument, reminds me of Sunstein's  Judicial minimalism :     But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be Republicans.      Avoid overly large uhh Thingies, and chop them up.     Cut up your Great Thingy into smaller independent ideas and treat them as independent. For instance, a marxist would cut up Marx's Great Thingy into theories of 1) value of labor 2) political relations between classes 3) wages 4) the ultimate political state of mankind.      Other interesting stuff    Taber and Lodge's  "Motivated skepticism in the evaluation of political beliefs"  describes six predictions which are very Haidt-y. It's a list of political thinkos that are driven by behavioral economic biases.    Beliefs don't need to be completely bullet proof. But this contradicts science, where a single counter example can topple a theory.     A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as the hits don’t keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in the court of public opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a false theory no successes.      On the uselessness of "Deep Wisdom":     Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say, “Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud, you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep Wisdom. There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all.      There's a distinction between Traditional rationalism and Bayesian rationalism. And I worry that the Bayesian variety, which Eliezer is a subscriber of, is a sort of hedgehogginess: a very focused and blindered approach. But I liked the idea that you can go beyond falsification, the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it.     I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer time in which to act. Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a second.      "Make America Great Again":     A key component of a zeitgeist is whether it locates its ideals in its future or its past. Nearly all cultures before the Enlightenment believed in a Fall from Grace – that things had once been perfect in the distant past, but then catastrophe had struck, and everything had slowly run downhill since then.      Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming (half way), (3/5) - August 2016    I bought this book 10 years ago, and it just sat on my shelf ever since. Not sure how I got into it in the first place, but my interest in lucid dreaming has increased as a result of my work on VR. As I delved into questions intimately tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner workings of our mind.    VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences never possible in a sense-rich environment.    I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall. So, while I'm unlikely to become an oneironaut, at the very least I've started a handwritten dream journal, which I keep on my bedside table.    The Persuaders (3/5) - July 2016    Rationality used to pervade English scene. Now no appeal to reason is even attempted.    Mostly arguments today are adversarial. In the past it was possible to have people with differing opinions not to resort to personal attacks. Appeal to reason hasn't always been the MO. It comes and goes and the author claims that were in an especially reason free era.     How crazy PR is : Nice case study looking into the political journalistic and other heavy machinery that is used to sway people. Particularly at the first Iraq war (about Kuwait), and swaying public opinion to the side of the US. Especially fascinating is the "Naira" girl who cried wolf, who claimed to be a Kuwaiti refugee suffering in Iraqi camps, but was actually a member of the Kuwaiti royal family. Especially interesting is the chain of money and influence and PR firms that takes that sort of inflammatory material and inject it into peoples' minds.  Remember "Free Kuwait" t-shirts? Courtesy of Hill and Nolton, a PR firm which was fed this information.    Astroturfing - creating fake grassroots movements that are actually sponsored by some corporation    Logical follow up or supplement to The Century of the Self.      Lebeau: the crowd is lacking reason, influenced by emotion, images.   Trotters: herd instinct, and group identity is key.   Lippmann: anti democratic conclusion that experts should run the show, not unwashed masses. regain critical faculties by understanding how PR works. also regulatory moves to make public deception illegal.       Soft vs. hard nudging . fundamentally people don't always know what is best for them, and government can step in. seatbelt laws force you to wear seat belts always (hard paternalism). GPS navigation systems don't force you to take their route, cigarette packs with graphic images: soft paternalism.     Shoving will backfire : if people feel nudged, they nudge back. U.K. had a test which gave job seekers a strength profile that was bogus. OIRA branch of the US and sunstein. what does the most good and least harm? regulations like showing calorie counts in fast food, environmental friendliness of consumer products, hidden costs in air tickets and credit card fees. good defaults matter too.     Reason &gt; nudging : reason based decisions will be more generally effective. rather than appealing to some auto response, if you can reach the underlying understanding, you're better off.    Some weaknesses: some parts, especially the ad related section, lists a lot of studies, but not the strengths of the effect. Also, largely a derivative work, mainly a summarization of other works: "Thinking Fast and Slow", "The Hidden Persuaders", "Orality and Literacy".    Strongest part: chapter 5 about politics, etc.     Efficacy of arguments : if dealing with people that agree already (eg. DNC to Democrats), provide a one-sided argument. Otherwise, go both ways. Discrediting the other POV is effective.    Garvey calls for a kind of thoughtful anger about persuasion. I concur, and this is what I'm channeling into Catma, for better or worse.    The Righteous Mind - July 2016 (5/5)    I discovered The Righteous Mind via  Jon Haidt's conversation with Sam Harris . I read it while on our Honeymoon, while Sarah was enjoying another book about morality. It was very romantic! Anyway, some thoughts on the book:    Haidt presents his argument in three parts. It's well structured, and super well written:      Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second (ie. people's morality is driven by intuition/gut reactions, and then they are really good at justifying their position through reasoning)   There's more to morality than harm and fairness (ie. conservatives care about many other things: authority, loyalty, sanctity -- this is the foundation of Moral Foundation Theory)   Morality binds and blinds (ie. arguments around group selection, social cohesion and other benefits of religion and partisanship)       Not moral relativism . In addition to borrowing from anthropology, Haidt recounts a personal story of his visit to India, and how initial visceral discomfort eventually transformed into some understanding of the cultural context he found himself in:     Understanding the simple fact that morality differs around the world, and even within societies, is the first step toward understanding your righteous mind.      I don't think that this is moral relativism, but moral descriptivism. Haidt does not claim that morality  ought  to differ around the world, simply that it does differ.     Nice analogies : I found the analogy of a small rider (the rational) riding a large elephant (the intuitive) apt and useful. Sort of like a lizard brain idea.      The elephant is far more powerful than the rider, but it is not an absolute dictator.  Under normal circumstances the rider takes its cue from the elephant, just as a lawyer takes instructions from a client. But if you force the two to sit around and chat for a few minutes, the elephant actually opens up to advice from the rider.       Against rationalism : Haidt presents an interesting argument against moral rationalism. Firstly, he makes a compelling case for religion as something that increases social capital via group selection, arguing against the New Atheist view that religion is evil, period, with no redeeming qualities.    Haidt argues for the Humeian view of morality, and against Bentham's utilitarian and Kant's deontological positions:     As Western societies became more educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic, the minds of its intellectuals changed. They became more analytic and less holistic.26 Utilitarianism and deontology became far more appealing to ethicists than Hume’s messy, pluralist, sentimentalist approach.      Haidt finds support for Hume's position, which is that intuition (or sentiment) comes first, and then reason tries really hard to come up with arguments to support that position. Haidt's subjects were     Morally dumbfounded — rendered speechless by their inability to explain verbally what they knew intuitively. These subjects were reasoning. They were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions.       On changing minds :     The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people.  If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the “other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying, and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. You may not agree, but you’ll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful and constructive yin-yang disagreement      He presents a framework for how this can happen:          Intuitions come first and reasoning is usually produced after a judgment is made, in order to influence other people. But as a discussion progresses, we sometimes change our intuitions and judgements.       Against Rawls :     Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people, times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges are variable.       Salient critiques of the left :     If you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you’re asking for trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist revolutions usually end up in despotism.       Conservative thinkers , like Frederich Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Jerry Muller, and Edmond Burke.  I ought to read them! Also, distinctions between conservatism and orthodoxy:     Christians who look to the Bible as a guide for legislation, like Muslims who want to live under sharia, are examples of orthodoxy. They want their society to match an externally ordained moral order, so they advocate change, sometimes radical change.  This can put them at odds with true conservatives, who see radical change as dangerous      2016 is a very confusing year. The media appears to have completely lost its ability to reason about or predict future political outcomes. Trump's nomination, Brexit, the rise of populism all over the world, appears mysterious and scary. In my left coast circles, the right is generally portrayed as either rich and evil, or poor and dumb.    The Righteous Mind provides a more convincing explanation for contemporary political divisions around differences in morality. Rather than just identifying low intellect, sheepishness, or fascist tendencies with right leaning populists, Haidt offers a useful framework for understanding the conservative world view. This book is a must read for any political observer with any hope for understanding.    Must Mankind Repeat History's Great Mistakes (Audio) - July 2016 (3/5)    Nice insight and guiding theme: international politics is complicated because there isn't really an organization that stands above all nations. Unlike other human endeavors, if a rogue entity misbehaves, there isn't really anyone to go to by default. Each country has its own skin to worry about, and they need to figure out the best strategy.    I liked the concept of the balance of power, presented in 3 versions by the lecturer:      Simply the distribution of existing power.   The state in which all parties in question have equal power   A tendency for new power entering a conflict to join the weak side in order to avoid a monopoly of power.      After one or two theoretical lectures, the course ventured into territory of WW1, the interwar years, and WW2. I found this part to be somewhat less engaging since most of the historical details were review for me, and little of the theory introduced at the beginning was brought into the fold. The last lecture was more interesting, since it tried to apply the theory introduced at the beginning to predict the future. What made it even more interesting is the fact that the lecture was recorded in the early 90s.    The lecturer wasn't very engaging, and I found myself listening to a lot of the lectures without getting much out of them. Additionally, the volume was low and the recording was poor quality, which contributed to my meta objections.    The man who loved only numbers (4/5) - July 2016    I really loved this one. It captures perfectly the quirkiness of Erdos, and his mathematician circles. Much more than a biography, this book popularizes a lot of incredibly interesting mathematics. It took me back 10 years to my math undergrad days.    The author does an incredible job of capturing the essence of many complex mathematical concepts in appealing and entertaining ways. It's instructive to compare the way this book tackles certain topics to the corresponding Wikipedia page, which is completely undecipherable by a non-mathematician, and often even by a mathematician that doesn't work in that domain. That said, I'm  not sure that this book would be as appreciated by someone without a background in math. But it may serve as inspiration for a motivated, mathematically-inclined high school student. I'll find out!    Despite having spent 4 years taking a bunch of math courses,  I learned a lot of new math from this book, and was reminded by some favorites.    Ramsey Theory: the inevitability of order in large quantities. We barely touched on Ramsey theory in 4th year Graph Theory, and it seemed really obscure. Not true! Draw any 5 points on a plane, and as long as 3 of them don't form a line, you are guaranteed to be able to form a convex quad using them as vertices. Take any sequence of 101 numbers, and you're guaranteed to find a subsequence of at least 10 increasing numbers.    Infinite series: a technical subject, but some really incredible results, like Taylor expansions of e (sum of 1/k!), pi (6 times sum of 1/k^2).    Cantor's analysis of various infinities (alpha numbers): firstly the beautiful argument about the countability of rational numbers, and then the famous diagonalization argument which proves that the set of real numbers is a bigger infinity.    Mother of All Demos - June 2016    http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/extra4/sloan/mousesite/1968Demo.html    As a Human Computer Interaction nerd, I feel the need to pay homage to history of the field. One glaring omission in my education is that I haven't fully watched "The Demo" where Douglas Englebart shows off the state of the art of "Man-Computer Interaction" circa 1968. The subject of the demo is NLS (Online system), which is intended as a synthesis of a bunch of ideas coming from SRI. It's quite impressive how far we've come, but also how many elements are still recognizable, and in some cases impressively ahead of their time.    The first ten minutes introduce a series of key concepts that are staples of desktop computing: the mouse and keyboard, mouse pointers, copy/paste, saving and loading files, numbered lists. Less mainstream, VI-like features are also introduced, such as reorderable, heirarchical lists, and folding sections. Much of what goes on under the hood in NLS reminded me of VIM script and other similar DSLs. Big focus on expert-oriented power usage.    The Demo heavily alludes to the web, with a lot of provisions for interlinking, cross referencing, and even an explicit mention of ARPA close to the end of the demo (Clip 33), which reminds the viewer that this is all pre-Intenet. In contrast, their (presumably telephone-based) video calling was quite impressive. The quality of the remote speaker seemed to be about as good (bad?) as Englebart's. Some collaborative features were quite impressive, with a real-time cursor sharing scheme which was decades ahead of its time. Others were less interesting, like leaving a message for other people in a file to "get a response within minutes".    Some time is spent showing off hardware. Most interestingly is the  Keyset , which was a 5-key ancestor of the chorded keyboard, where each key combination (31 in total) led to a character, and was intended as a one handed keyboard. Also interesting as a point of comparison was the cutting edge display tech of the time: black and white CRTs with 15 Hz refresh rates and super high (3 frame) persistence.    The philosophy of the lab behind MOAD was close to my heart, and lives on in R&amp;D groups I've had the pleasure of being part of:      Build and try: big focus on prototyping!   Evolutionary: make incremental improvements to a real system, not grand visions.   Eat your own dogfood: use the thing you build, and test it on yourself.      The One Minute Manager - June 2016 (4/5)    This little book was recommended to me by a ski instructor after a ski lesson at Squaw.  The man was probably in his 70s, but skied incredibly well, and had a lot of wisdom to pass on. He was tough, but nice, like a One Minute Manager.    More of a pamphlet than a book, One Minute Manager unfolds as a story about a young man wanting to learn to be a good people manager. The story makes the points more vivid, but at its core, there is an interesting and somewhat surprising strategy outlined for being a good hands off manager. The approach reminds me a little bit of Christian's management style. There are three parts:      Set goals and expectations with the employee, write them down succinctly and have them ready for review. (This is similar to Google OKRs, and definitely worthwhile).   Especially early on, look for behaviors that are praise-worthy, and give due praise honestly and directly. (This seems like a great idea to try on interns).   Reprimand unwanted behavior as it happens, but emphasize their worth as people. (This seems quite hard to pull off without being a dick).      Gantenbein by Max Frisch - June 2016 (4/5)    Gantenbein was recommended to me by a close friend, who said it made a really big impact on him. It took me a long time to get through this book, and I often struggled to follow the narrative. The author writes in a very experimental style, alternating between three different men, all of which are in love with Lila, a beautiful stage actress. Events that happen don't seem to have chronology or causation. Sometimes they branch out into multiple futures, other times you reset in another time, another place, and as another person.  The book is a set of sketches around these people, more so than a coherent whole. Adding to the complexity, the narrator himself seems to not be a single person, but alternates between people. And this smoke and mirrors is explicit. The author often writes "I imagine...", and the title is more accurately translated "Let's assume my name is Gantenbein".    I found this book to be a piercing view into human nature. I could relate to much of what the characters within it struggle with, which made reading it difficult and slow. Gantenbein, one of the protagonists, decides to pretend to be blind for his whole life, and builds a relationship with Lila. He wears dark glasses, which conceal his lie from others. But he himself has to be careful not to reveal his secret. He can see, but must pretend that he can't, and this leads to painful allegory on good relationships.    This book was hard to read. I never got into a flow, and ended up reading very unevenly, often wanting to set it down for a while. But some parts I really loved, like when one of the characters attends his own funeral. And I was surprised to, after finishing it, have a feeling that some coherence emerged by the end. My understanding of this book would benefit from a re-reading, but I know that this is unlikely to happen.    Audio lectures: Physics Beyond the Edge - June 2016 (4/5)    An interesting follow up to what I remember from high school &amp; first year physics. My guess is that the subject of the class is too basic for those with a degree in physics, but this is something I should ask Alex! I really liked how all of the topics flowed into each other. I found this to be somewhat surprising given Einstein's failed struggle to find some unified theory of everything. This is probably credit to the lecturer, who, in addition to being a great instructor, also coined the term  qubit .    The structure of the class follows Arthur C. Clark's second law:     The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.      The lecturer, Benjamin Schumacher, is quite engaging, and starts by breaking impossibility down in terms of logical, physical and statistical terms. He then goes into thermodynamics, framing the first and second laws in terms of  perpetual motion machines .    I enjoyed the various Demons that show up in this lecture.  Maxwell's demon  can control a flap between two chambers to make sure that eventually all of the molecules end up in one of the chambers (thus decreasing entropy).  Laplace's demon  is able to, from knowing the current state of the world, predict the future perfectly. Both of these thought experiments are forays into the impossible that, when disproven, set the stage for the third law of thermodynamics and chaos / quantum mechanics.    The section on space-time was fascinating, and served as a good introduction to space-time diagrams (aka  Minkowski diagrams ), which I really liked. Although, one thing that was missing is the visual element. Although very lightweight in mathematical treatment, there were clearly some materials that supplemented the lectures, which would have made learning easier. The whole discussion on faster-than-light travel, time travel, and quantum cloning was tied together nicely through the lens of the impossible. By the way, space-time diagrams seem to be the reason for this  observable universe thing .    Which brings us to Quantum. I've been interested in being interested in the topic for a while because it's so unintuitive and strange. Schumacher's overview is good, but I'm obviously still very confused. He outlines basics of Quantum Mechanics:      Wave-particle duality: light has both wave and particle like behaviors.   Uncertainty: position and momentum of a quantum particle cannot both be known.   Tunneling: because of this uncertainty, quantum particles can tunnel through what in newtonian mechanics are inpenetrable barriers.      There seem to be some fundamental truths about symmetry as pertaining to conservation laws.  Noether's theorem  seems remarkably deep but way over my head, which states that every symmetry in physics has some associated conservation law.    I was also somewhat lost in the information theory asides (the lecturer's specialty is information theory). That information theory is a branch of physics at all is mysterious to me. Probably worth learning more about, though, given my information-related profession.    Audio lectures: Great Ideas of Philosophy - May 2016 (5/5)    Really great series of 60 lectures – that's 24 hours worth as an overview of philosophers and their main points. I took very few sporadic notes, as the majority of my listening was done while riding a bicycle. Here are some of my favorite philosophers and their quotes:    Thomas Reid's [principle of credulity][]:     If no proposition that is uttered in discourse would be believed, until it was examined and tried by reason … most men would be unable to find reasons for believing the thousandth part of what is told them. Such distrust and incredulity would deprive us of the greatest benefits of society.       Wittgenstein's beetle :     Imagine, he says, that everyone has a small box in which they keep a beetle. However, no one is allowed to look in anyone else’s box, only in their own. Over time, people talk about what is in their boxes and the word “beetle” comes to stand for what is in everyone’s box.      Everything about  Socrates . This is a treasure trove to be revisited.     The unexamined life is not worth living.      The stoic mindset, especially this quote attributed to  Epictetus :     Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned it."      Kant's [Categorical Imperative][kant], in a few formulations:     Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.      ...and     Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.      and...     Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.      And closely related, Rawls'  Original Position , although the lecturer  Daniel N. Robinson  is surprisingly dismissive of his ideas.    Karl Popper's ideas around  falsification :     Falsifiability or refutability of a statement, hypothesis, or theory is the inherent possibility that it can be proven false. A statement is called falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates the statement in question. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with nullify, meaning to invalidate or "show to be false".      The debate between realism and anti-realism: whether or not scientific theory describes what the world is actually like, or if it just serves as a nice model. A succinct summary of the two positions:     Realists see scientific inquiry as discovery while anti-realists sees it as invention.      Clarence Irving Lewis and the idea of qualia, especially well illustrated in  "Mary's room" , which produces an interesting anti-materialist argument:     The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.      After nearly 24 hours of lecturing, Daniel synthesizes a lot of philosophical thought into what constitutes a good life:      Fatalism: being OK with your fate.   Hedonism: the good kind, aiming to increase long term pleasure.   Selflessness: benevolent, philanthropic behavior   Activity: don't become a brain in a vat :)      How to fail at almost everything and still win big by Scott Adams - April 2016 (1/5)    Let's be clear: this is a self help book. I somehow got suckered into reading it because I liked one of his blog posts. There are very few interesting or original things in the book, and the author comes off as brash and trying too hard to be funny. That said, I liked some ideas:       Systems vs goals. Focusing on achievement leads to emptiness after the fact. Instead focus on a system and process.      Simplifiers vs optimizers is an interesting dichotomy. Usually it's about optimizers vs satisficers but in this case I can see myself as a simplifier.      Don't listen to friends and family feedback on business ideas. Listen to the market.        Most of the rest of the book can be reduced to common sense: eat well, exercise daily. Some of Scott's specific advice is really uninspired and downright depressing. He insists that you should learn to play golf, learn a second language, how to use proper English grammar, how to be outgoing, a good conversationalist and a public speaker. He devotes a chapter of the book to learning a special command voice in order to manipulate people better. Move along!    art of tidying by Marie Kondo - April 2016 (3/5)    An endearing manual for tidying up. I'm naturally inclined to minimalism as it stands and did a massive cleanup of my old room in my parents house just last month so consider myself proficient. But Marie takes it to the next level, revealing an autistic inclination towards the personification of inanimate objects.     This manifesto can easily be reduced to an illustrated one pager, but Marie insists on treading over the same ground multiple times.       Discard everything you don't need by determining if it sparks joy. Go by category, starting with clothes, moving on to books and personal items.    Once you've donated garbage bags full of items, organize them so that everything you own has a place. Stand everything including clothes vertically.       By the end if the book I was curious more about Marie's eccentricity than her organizational method.     The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris - March 2016 (4/5)    In many ways a rehashing of many ideas in philosophy, I think Sam did a good job of bringing some longstanding ideas and debates to the fore without requiring a degree in philosophy. The section on religion can be skipped, since he rehashes old theses from End of Faith (oh yeah, hobby horse!)    The overall thesis is that the well being of conscious entities is of supreme importance, and that morality is all about optimizing that. Intuitively, I agree that this is a good, pragmatic, and secular definition. I am less interested in the philosophical debate around it, but I don't think Sam adequately addresses the other side of the argument adequately. Debates between utilitarian ideas and other branches of philosophy have been raging for centuries, and with all due respect, I don't think Sam is the guy to put them to rest.    Despite well being's illusive nature, Sam draws a parallel to health, which is also difficult to pin down precisely. While the analogy is illustrative, health is easier to define, and has been done out of practical necessity with metrics like QALYs. Though flawed, a QALY-like metric that includes all aspects of well being seems out of reach in 2016.    With that said, Sam hedges heavily against this reality, and repeatedly says that we may not know what the best collective course of action is, but that one (or in fact many) must surely exist. These many local minima are the peaks of The Moral Landscape.    A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter m. Miller Jr - February 2016 (5/5)    Amazing.     Q masterpiece in three parts. The setting is post apocalyptic earth after a mutually assured nuclear destruction scenario occurred in the 20th century.     While most of humanity has undergone the simplification, a small order of Christian monks is dedicated to preserving human civilization. Their patron saint, St. Leibowitz, an engineer from before The Deluge. After a bomb shelter with his blueprint is discovered by a primitive monk, a religious scandal unfolds, reminiscent of what might have happened in the dark ages to Galileo.     Many centuries later the blueprint is finally understood by a scientist frustrated by a lack of truly novel discoveries. And an engineer from the same order builds it. It is a simple electrical generator which powersq a lamp.     Eventually humanity returns to its pre Deluge level of technology and surpasses it, achieving the ability to travel to exoplanets. But political strife is once again at an alarming level. And as earth nears nuclear annihilation again, the order of leibowitz prepares to preserve the blueprints and other critical documents and send them, along with a small order of monks, to another planet for resettlement.     The characters are vividly painted, and the historical projection of the dark ages onto a modern technological background is fascinating and masterfully crafted. The book serves as a stark reminder that there is no natural progression toward better  times, and just how fragile our current paradise is.     The threat of nuclear war may feel like a bygone but I'm quite concerned about it still.     In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays by Bertrand Russell (4/5) - December 2015    Fascinating collection of essays. In "In praise of idleness", Russell in 1930 predicts that automation will reduce the working day drastically. If your quota of 1000 buttons can be fulfilled in 1/10th the time, you should have a lot more time for pursuing your hobbies. Unfortunately this never happened.     In one of the essays, he declares himself as a socialist while simultaneously distancing from marx, and Russian communism. Essentially he lays groundwork for social democracy. His views on socialism are very reasonable and still relevant today.     Gateway by Frederik Pohl (4/5) - December 2015    Humanity discovers an advanced civilization, which has become extinct, but has left a mysterious Gateway in our solar system. Gateway is a small world which houses many ships capable of taking adventurers on missions to undisclosed locations. The controls are cryptic, but slowly residents of gateways gain a better understanding of how they work. Gateway is controlled by a conspicuously evil trans-national corporation, which pays prospectors to take dangerous trips on these ships with the  in hopes of discovery. They pay out lucrative bonuses.    The protagonist, an unsympathetic, and cowardly Robinette (aka Bob), comes to gateway to try to strike it rich. He struggles with his own fears of going on missions, and falls in love with Klara. Their dysfunctional relationship, his troubled childhood, and pathological fear is woven deeply into the structure of the book. Chapters alternate between Bob's memories on Gateway and Bob the rich ex-prospector getting therapy sessions from a sentient Robo-psychoanalyst on Earth. Bob's last mission ends in disaster, as he is separated from his beloved as their ships try to escape from a black hole. Bob returns the sole survivor, gets an inordinate amount of money from the corporation, but remains forever unhappy, missing Klara and suffering from immense guilt.    Overall I liked the book. It was well written and captivating, reminding in some ways of Robert Heinlein, but maybe a bit more dystopian. There were many familiar tropes such as a very inter-ratial cast with exotic combinations of first and last names, like Dane Metchnikov. Bob's adventures with hot space babes are also I think a hallmark of this style of science fiction. I also enjoyed Pohl's excerpts of Gateway public announcements, mission reports and classifieds littered throughout the book.    Sophie's World by Jostein Gaardner (5/5) - November 2015    I really enjoyed this one. Clearly a novel for kids, this book provides a nice overview of philosophy. However it is also quite entertaining. Events center around Sophie and her mysterious philosophy teacher. Initially I was disappointed, since it read like a philosophy class given to the reader through letters sent to Sophie, but as the plot thickened, the format changed to socratic dialog.    After a somewhat dry start, it is revealed that in fact the author is himself a fictional character writing a book to her daughter, which reveals a lot of the strangeness that happens in Sophie's World. Towards the end, her world becomes increasingly exciting and fantastical, with cameos from more and more strange fictional characters including Nils and the wild geese. And then it unravels, when Sophie's fictional philosophy teacher reveals to everyone in their world that they are living inside a fiction book. This self-referential trick reminds of Borges and Hofstadter.    I was quite impressed that the Gaardner was able to fit a full intro to philosophy course into a relatively short book, and still make it entertaining. It passed my bar with flying colors and I'm keen to give it to Ben. It can be his high school philosophy class!    Audio lectures: the United States and the Middle East (3/5) - October 2015    A historical account of modern middle eastern history from a US lens. Covers the period between the late Ottoman Empire and September 11th, 2001 and its aftermath.    I found the course illuminating, with some clarity on various infighting rivalries within the Muslim world. Also a recap of Israeli history through an Arab lens was interesting to hear along with additional details on all of the major wars and their historical impact. I really liked the late 20th century lens on US presidents as well: fascinating to view it through the middle eastern lens.     The lecturer is quite biased toward the Arab states, which is not a stance I am used to. At the same time it is clear he tries to moderate himself to better appeal to a wider liberal audience. The argument that Israel and American imperialism is largely to blame for problems in the Middle East runs deeply through the lecturers narrative. And I suppose that this stance is not so controversial among liberals too!    Often citing nuances like the definition of Jihad, and underplaying ideological opposition in favor of external factor mentality, the lecturer makes his bias very clear in parts. The continuous emphasis on the Israeli occupation gets old fast. But his stance is not so extreme that he denies that there are genuinely endemic problems, such as bitter infighting, a general reluctance of the Arab world to come to the aid of the Palestinian cause, and homegrown (i.e. Not created by the us) terrorists like Osama bin Laden and organizations like Hamas, though he never actually calls it a terrorist organization.     Anyway mixed feeling at the end, since too many of my thoughts were wasted on decomposing the lecturers bias and not enough spent to process the actual content. Also the speaking cadence made it quite hard to listen to. Ended up going to 1.5x by the end, which I rarely do.     Science and Human Values (3/5) - September 2015    Broznowski tries really hard to impress with his breadth of knowledge. He constantly drops references to art, literature and philosophy to make his point. It's as if he is using himself as an example of a scientist who is also well versed in liberal art (there are dozens of us!!). I found most of the writing to be very fluffy, deliberately convoluted, and kind of annoying. I had a hard time finishing despite it being such a short read. I set the book down for a month, and returned to it later (upon returning from vacation).    In the first part, Broznowski makes the argument that science isn't in and of itself good or evil, but just a tool. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he attributes not to the invention of the atomic bomb, but to the politicians that chose to use it. Seems like a pretty basic argument, but also flawed and not new. Not being well versed in the philosophy of Science, not in a good position to judge it.    In the third and final essay, Broznowski considers science as a social institution, and compares it to the rest of society. This part I thought was interesting.  Science has many attractive, democratic properties that I agree could really stand to be ported into other human domains.    Thinking Fast and Slow (5/5) - September 2015    An excellent read. Kahneman basically summarizes his career as a psychologist, in which he systematically found flaws in human ability to think rationally. He's a founder of behavioral economics, which describes the ways in which humans make systematic thinking errors (deviating from "pure" rationality)..    Audio: Skeptic's Guide to American History (4/5) - August 2015    Well done overview of American History with a historiographical twist. Reminded me of Mr. Begin's history classes, but probably a little more sophisticated. I really liked the lecturer's call to skepticism which rang throughout, as he questioned theme after theme of cliche Americanisms. I really liked his spiral model of historical progress, and also the fact that he dropped enough references that I now have plenty of follow up work to do. A worthwhile course for any non-American. Buy it on  TTC .    Digital Signal Processing Coursera (3/5) - Finished in July 2015    https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004/    Professors Martin Vetterli &amp; Paolo Prandoni give an in-depth introduction to digital signals, filtering, etc. A caveat: I only went through the first 10 (out of 18) days of lectures, and did only some of the homework assignments.    Initially spurred on by a broad interest in music, audio, and sensor processing, this course served as a very solid theoretical foundation.  The course starts off with a very dry, theoretical exploration into Hilbert spaces, which served as an excellent reminder that I can still sort of understand and enjoy mathematics. However my somewhat pathetic mathematical abilities were stretched to their absolute limit by Vetterli's systematic barrage of theory, and I would have surely given up on day 2 if not for some of those upper year linear algebra classes (thanks UBC!).    The lecture's first focus is on  how to understand signals . Still shaky on some of the theory, the lecture delves deep into the theory of fourier analysis and the formal definition of the discrete fourier analysis and various related methods like the DTFT. The treatment of the subject is so dry, it's hard to breathe. Until as if in a sudden rainstorm, the theoretical desert can breathe again when finally they bring up examples of the STFT, which I have been using for a while for various audio-related applications at work, without knowing what it was called.    The next big subject is  transforming signals , or signal processing.  Here, the professors introduce LTIs formally, and derive the idea that an impulse response fully characterizes an LTI. Next they dive into simple filters, FIRs and IIRs, covering various types of averages, discussing filter stability and other formal properties. They try to build some intuition about filters from a frequency-domain perspective, which is very useful to me. Lastly, the subject of ideal filters is explored, as well as why such filters cannot be implemented in real life.     Finally, they discuss how to actually design filters using the z-transform, whose derivation remains somewhat mysterious to me, which is unfortunately normal for an engineering course. Prandoni gives a good interpretation for the pole-zero plot, which is a really elegant way of looking at filters. The lecture turns practical for a brief moment, when they reveal that implementations already exist for non-ideal versions of many of these filters and explore a few differences between Butterworth, Chebyshev and Elliptic low pass filters. They also talk about FIRs, and I finally understand the jargon of 'taps', which I just heard about at a lecture held at Noisebridge.    I still struggle to convert block diagrams into equations, but feel like I have a much better sense of second order IIRs that ship with the Web Audio API. Overall a mathematically challenging, but interesting class.  I really wish there was a better way to build intuition for a lot of the theory, though.    Audio: Understanding the Secrets of Human Perception (4/5) -- June 2015    http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/understanding-the-secrets-of-human-perception.html    Excellent overview of perception. I learned a ton from these lectures, and really want to enumerate all of the illusions and experiments that the lecturer cites which give insight into the way our senses work. Lots of in-depth material about our visual system, how we percieve motion, the incredible variety of depth cues, as well as after-images and color effects. Some senses, like audition, were largely review for me, but others, like olfaction and taste were completely new to me. Multi-modal perception gets especially interesting, the canonical illusion being the McGurk effect, but  there are many more .    This course is much more than just enumerated sensory illusions, though.  The great thing about it is that Vishton spends a fair amount of time on the general principles of operation of our brains, from fundamentals of neurons and synapses to opponent-process theory, which explains a great deal of perception phenomena across the senses. From a UX and VR perspective, the material in this course is totally invaluable.     John Napier - Hands (4/5) -- May 2015    Really interesting deep-dive into human hands from many different perspectives: anatomical, evolutionary, functional and social. The book is packed with facts. For example, I had no idea the carpal bones were so numerous and complex! Also, it's nice to understand why human opposition differs from monkeys and the Opposability Index. Lots of interesting insights into distribution of handedness, including that certain species of monkeys are predominantly left handed, which is surprising on several levels. Napier also goes a bit into fingerprints, basic patterns, and mentioning some relation to worn-off finger prints in people with Celiac. It was fun to cross-correlate what was written in the book with my own hands.    Overall a thoroughly interesting account and I found good insights from an HCI perspective. I did think that the second part on social and cultural aspects was too brief and incomplete.        With the eye, the hand is our main source of contact with the physical environment. The hand has advantages over the eye because it can observe the environment by means of touch, and having observed it, it can immediately proceed to do something about it. The hand has other great advantages over the eye. It can see around corners and it can see in the dark.      Vernor Vinge (2/5) - Rainbow's End -- April 2015    Real science fiction, in a bad way, focusing more on the science than the fiction, Asimov style. Not that great of a book, underdeveloped characters, contrived plot. Really felt like it was written by a technologist, unlike say Bashert by my former CS professor. The main reason I read it was for is focus on VR, but even for that I got bored about half way through and had to force myself to finish.    The library allegory felt too obvious, as if the author was just shoving the out with the old, in with the new in your face.    Blue Mind (3/5) -- March 2015    The message was good and clear, but the writing was tedious. Like Gladwell books, this one could be compressed to a short pamphlet. I liked the distinction between hedonism and eudaimonia, which was a very ancillary point in the book, but still new to me. I also liked the blue marble finish. But the meat of the book consists of an glorified enumeration of activities related to water.  ">

      <p>I read Godel Escher Bach many years ago and really enjoyed it at the time. When
I got my hands on this book, I was excited to read a late Doug Hofstadter work.
To my surprise, by the end of Chapter 3, I was done with it. This book had none
of the variety of its predecessor, and not much in terms of new ideas (as far as
I can remember). I competely agreed with a goodreads review of it, courtesy of
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/148256192?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1">Zach</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Conceptually, I guess you could say, I enjoyed it, but the presentation -
the language of the author, the over-long format, and the strange mixture of
hard math and elementary philosophy - diminished and diluted the content to
the point that it was barely worth reading. The first problem is
Hofstadter’s “aww shucks” Uncle Fluffy writing style. His language is so
steeped in a fireside chat mentality that the meat of his ideas is
completely devoured by his good-natured cleverness.

<h2>The Hedgehog and the Fox (4/5) - September 2016</h2>

<pre><code>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.
-- Archilochus
</code></pre>

<p>According to Isaiah Berlin, Tolstoy is a natural fox who wanted to be a
hedgehog. IB suggests that Tolstoy was too broad minded to be able to fully
embrace a single doctrine, which could satisfactorily explain how the world works:</p>

<pre><code>Any comforting theory which attempted to collect, relate, 'synthesize'
reveal hidden substrata and concealed inner connections, which, though not
apparent to the naked eye, nevertheless guaranteed the unity of all
things... [Tolstoy] exploded without difficulty.
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time, Tolstoy wanted to be able to find some Einsteinian unified
theory of everything (TOE), but was too talented as a critic to be able to do
so.</p>

<pre><code>What oppressed Tolstoy most was his lack of positive convictions; and that
famous passage in Anna Karenina in which Levin's brother tells him that he-
Levin- has no positive beliefs.
</code></pre>

<p>This division within himself caused him great pain at the end of his life.</p>

<p>As you can see, the writing here is not flowery, but rather complex and requires
a high degree of attention. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I lacked given
the circumstances of moving to Seattle.</p>

<p>This short book / essay was supposedly intended as a joke (an elaborate one, at
90 pages). Part of the fun is classifying people into animals, for example,
here's IB's take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foxes: Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin,
Shakespeare, Balzac and Joyce</li>
<li>Hedgehogs: Dante, Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Neitzsche,
Ibsen and Proust</li>
</ul>

<p>My conclusion is that Foxes &gt; Hedgehogs. The world really is complex, and a
simple unified theory seems very unlikely. Also, I'll have to read more IB,
in less turbulent circumstances. And more Tolstoy!</p>

<h2>Sapiens (5/5) - September 2016</h2>

<p>Yuval Noah Harari presents an outside view of humanity, from the perspective of
a complete outsider, an alien with no particular interest in the human species.
This is fascinating.</p>

<p>The scope of the book is very broad and often high level, starting with physics
and chemistry 13.5 billion years ago at the dawn of the universe. Then, he turns
to biology, which begins 3.8 billion years ago on earth, and finally to history
and the cognitive revolution which starts about 70,000 years ago. Since then,
12,000 years ago, we had agriculture, which sped up the cognitive revolution.
More recently, 500 years ago, the scientific revolution really turned it up a
notch. The orders of magnitude of difference are appropriately humbling.</p>

<p>I liked the distinction between objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. The
latter meaning something that exists within the communication network linking
the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes
his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.</p>

<p>Also striking was Harari's disdain for the agricultural revolution. He claims
that it made most people worse off. The general point being that "history's
choices are not made for the benefit of humans".</p>

<p>Another major theme is the unification of humankind, which compounds
inter-subjective effects since societies grow bigger and bigger. Over time,
cultures coalesce and form bigger and more complex civilisations. Even though
today's civilizations seem to be clashing, they actually agree on many things,
for example money. "For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers, and prophets
have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may,
money is also the apogee of human tolerance."</p>

<p>On religion, Harari has insights as well:</p>

<pre><code>So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains
evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the
riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the
entire universe - and He's evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach
for such a belief.
</code></pre>

<p>Also, interestingly, he considers most "isms" to be religions. And this leads to
interesting analyses. Harari delves deeply into humanism which he breaks down
into three kinds:</p>

<ol>
<li>Liberal humanism: that 'humanity' is a quality of individual humans, and that
the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct.</li>
<li>Socialist humanism: hold as sacred not the inner voice of each individual,
but the species Homo sapiens as a whole.</li>
<li>Evolutionary humanism: humankind is not something universal and eternal, but
rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter has a long connection to Nazism, but Harari suggests (and I agree)
that modern biology is really pushing us back into that vein.</p>

<p>On the scientific revolution, Harari echoes the rational sentiment of accepting
ignorance. As soon as you truly accept that you do not know, you leave the door
open to new insights.</p>

<pre><code>The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has
been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched
the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the
answers to their most important questions.
</code></pre>

<p>Overall, very worth a read (or listen, as I did).</p>

<h2>How to actually change your mind by Eliezer Yudkowsky (4/5) - August 2016</h2>

<p>Technically the second book in a giant epic entitled "Rationality: From AI to
Zombies". The author is a well known rationalist and active member/founder of
lesswrong.org, Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), etc.</p>

<p>Essentially, this is a series of essays written and published as "The
sequences", around 2009. They are loosely related and cover a wide array of
topics, many of them highlighting irrational modes of thought. Much of the work
focuses on biases central to behavioral economics, focusing on Kahneman-style
results. But the author goes beyond that, and also introduces a lot of opinion
for how a rationalist should behave. At the same time, there is a tendency to be
incredibly nerdy, which is alternatingly endearing and borderline autistic. I
found myself asking the question: if one becomes a purely rational agent, isn't
a computer strictly better? On the path to rationality, what aspects of humanity
is worth preserving?</p>

<p>Here's some new stuff I learned. A fair amount of the book covers behavioral
economics concepts that I read about already in TF&amp;S.</p>

<p>Litanies</p>

<p>Aumann’s Agreement Theorem suggests that no two rationalists can agree to
disagree, given that they have the same information.</p>

<p>Litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin">Gendlin</a>:</p>

<pre><code>What is true is already so.
Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
People can stand what is true,
for they are already enduring it.
</code></pre>

<p>Litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski">Tarski</a>:</p>

<pre><code>If the box contains a diamond,
I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond;
If the box does not contain a diamond,
I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond;
Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.
</code></pre>

<h2>Against black and white thinking</h2>

<p>Yudkowsky is especially effective in his attacks on binary thinking. For
example, on partisanship:</p>

<pre><code>Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once
you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side,
and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side, otherwise it's
like stabbing your soldiers in the back - providing aid and comfort to the
enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides
of an issue in their professional life as scientists can suddenly turn into
slogan-chanting zombies when there's a Blue or Green position on an issue.
</code></pre>

<p>On the tendency and fallacy in binary thought:</p>

<pre><code>There is a natural tendency to treat discussion as a form of combat, an
extension of war, a sport; and in sports you only need to keep track of how
many points have been scored by each team. There are only two sides, and
every point scored against one side is a point in favor of the other.
Everyone in the audience keeps a mental running count of how many points
each speaker scores against the other. At the end of the debate, the speaker
who has scored more points is, obviously, the winner; so everything that
speaker says must be true, and everything the loser says must be wrong.
</code></pre>

<p>The horns effect - all negative qualities correlate:</p>

<pre><code>Stalin also believed that 2 + 2 = 4. Yet if you defend any statement made by
Stalin, even “2 + 2 = 4,” people will see only that you are agreeing with
stalin and you must be on his side.
</code></pre>

<p>And a very nice summary of a better way of thinking:</p>

<pre><code>Not all arguments reduce to mere up or down. Lady Rationality carries a
notebook, wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side.
</code></pre>

<p>Real belief vs. belief in belief:</p>

<pre><code>Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus
“wanting to write.” Mark Twain said: “A classic is something that everyone
wants to have read and no one wants to read.” Criticizing yourself from a
sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, so that you’ll be
able to say afterward that your faith is not blind. This is not the same as
wanting to investigate.
</code></pre>

<h2>Assume your interlocutor is good</h2>

<p>"To argue against an idea honestly, you should argue against the best arguments
of the strongest advocates". This, and the closely related concept of the
principle of charity aka Steelmanning (the opposite of strawmanning), which I
heard from a Sam Harris interview, sent me on a long reading tangent of
arguments <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2016/08/on-steelmanning-arguments-and-personally-customizing-them/">for</a> and <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/against-steelmanning/">against</a>. Insightful tidbit from that
last link:</p>

<pre><code>First, seek to understand the actual viewpoints people you disagree with are actually advocating.
Second, seek out intelligent and well-informed advocates of viewpoints you disagree with. You don’t have to make up what your opponents believe! As it happens, you have many smart opponents!
Third, whenever possible, try to switch conversations from a debate focus to a collaborative truth-seeking focus.
</code></pre>

<p>Back to Big Yud. Some wisdom on focusing on the argument, not on the person:</p>

<pre><code>Someone once said "Not all conservatives are stupid, but most stupid people
are conservatives". If you cannot place yourself in a state of mind where
this statement, true or false, seems completely irrelevant as a critique of
conservatism, you are not ready to think rationally about politics.
</code></pre>

<p>A variation on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/">reasonable person principle</a> (harkens back to my time
at CMU).</p>

<pre><code>To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that
everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange,
mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their
surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being
in. [...] Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with
themselves as the villains.
</code></pre>

<h2>Deciding which side to argue</h2>

<p>Great distinction between rationality and rationalization. Very related to
Haidt's position that beliefs are intuitive but their defence is rational. But
Haidt makes no distinction like this. Would love to hear his thoughts on it.</p>

<pre><code>Rationality is not for winning debates, it is for deciding which side to
join. If you’ve already decided which side to argue for, the work of
rationality is done within you, whether well or poorly. But how can you,
yourself, decide which side to argue?
</code></pre>

<p>Eliezer suggests enumerating the evidence: "Lady Rationality carries a notebook,
wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side". Here's how
to construct an honest ultrarational argument for a particular political
candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather all evidence about the different candidates</li>
<li>Make a checklist which you will use to decide which candidate is best</li>
<li>Process the checklist</li>
<li>Go to the winning candidate</li>
<li>Offer to become their campaign manager</li>
<li>Use the checklist as the campaign literature</li>
</ul>

<h2>The future is hard to predict</h2>

<p>Herd instinct in venture capitalism:</p>

<pre><code>The majority of venture capitalists at any given time are all chasing the
same Revolutionary Innovation, and it’s the Revolutionary Innovation that
IPO’d six months ago. This is an especially crushing observation in venture
capital, because there’s a direct economic motive to not follow the herd.
</code></pre>

<p>And what to do about it. DFJ (a VC) has a rule <a href="http://www.signallake.com/innovation/CrazyIdeasSuccessfulVC101009.pdf">favoring a passionate
minority</a> to outweigh a negative majority.  This also reminds me of the
<a href="https://www.quora.com/World-War-Z-2013-movie-Do-the-Israelis-really-have-a-10th-man-doctrine">Tenth Man Rule</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Only two partners need to agree in order to fund any startup up to $1.5
million. And if all the partners agree that something sounds like a good
idea, they won’t do it.
</code></pre>

<p>Movies and books have a huge effect on the human psyche. This will probably
compound with more immersive storytelling mediums:</p>

<pre><code>So far as I can tell, few movie viewers act as if they have directly
observed Earth’s future. [...] But those who commit the fallacy seem to act
as if they had seen the movie events occurring on some other planet; not
Earth, but somewhere similar to Earth.
</code></pre>

<p>Predicting numbers is especially difficult:</p>

<pre><code>I observe that many futuristic predictions are, likewise, best considered as
attitude expressions. Take the question, “How long will it be until we have
human-level AI?” The responses I’ve seen to this are all over the map.
</code></pre>

<h2>Avoid having THE Great Idea and get granular and specific</h2>

<p>Avoiding partisanship by focusing on the minimum viable argument, reminds me of
Sunstein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_minimalism">Judicial minimalism</a>:</p>

<pre><code>But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly
avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in
school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it
explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be
Republicans.
</code></pre>

<p>Avoid overly large uhh Thingies, and chop them up.</p>

<pre><code>Cut up your Great Thingy into smaller independent ideas and treat them as
independent. For instance, a marxist would cut up Marx's Great Thingy into
theories of 1) value of labor 2) political relations between classes 3)
wages 4) the ultimate political state of mankind.
</code></pre>

<h2>Other interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Taber and Lodge's <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x/abstract">"Motivated skepticism in the evaluation of political
beliefs"</a> describes six predictions which are very Haidt-y. It's a list
of political thinkos that are driven by behavioral economic biases.</p>

<p>Beliefs don't need to be completely bullet proof. But this contradicts
science, where a single counter example can topple a theory.</p>

<pre><code>A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as
the hits don’t keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in
the court of public opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a
false theory no successes.
</code></pre>

<p>On the uselessness of "Deep Wisdom":</p>

<pre><code>Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say,
“Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud,
you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep
Wisdom. There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A
fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the
same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all.
</code></pre>

<p>There's a distinction between Traditional rationalism and Bayesian rationalism.
And I worry that the Bayesian variety, which Eliezer is a subscriber of, is a
sort of hedgehogginess: a very focused and blindered approach. But I liked the
idea that you can go beyond falsification, the ability to relinquish an initial
opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it.</p>

<pre><code>I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on
thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t
yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer
time in which to act. Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a
second.
</code></pre>

<p>"Make America Great Again":</p>

<pre><code>A key component of a zeitgeist is whether it locates its ideals in its
future or its past. Nearly all cultures before the Enlightenment believed in
a Fall from Grace – that things had once been perfect in the distant past,
but then catastrophe had struck, and everything had slowly run downhill
since then.
</code></pre>

<h2>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming (half way), (3/5) - August 2016</h2>

<p>I bought this book 10 years ago, and it just sat on my shelf ever since. Not
sure how I got into it in the first place, but my interest in lucid dreaming has
increased as a result of my work on VR. As I delved into questions intimately
tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner
workings of our mind.</p>

<p>VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory
deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences
never possible in a sense-rich environment.</p>

<p>I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually
interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in
my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to
understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of
lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall. So, while I'm unlikely to become an
oneironaut, at the very least I've started a handwritten dream journal, which I
keep on my bedside table.</p>

<h2>The Persuaders (3/5) - July 2016</h2>

<p>Rationality used to pervade English scene. Now no appeal to reason is even
attempted.</p>

<p>Mostly arguments today are adversarial. In the past it was possible to have
people with differing opinions not to resort to personal attacks. Appeal to
reason hasn't always been the MO. It comes and goes and the author claims that
were in an especially reason free era.</p>

<p><em>How crazy PR is</em>: Nice case study looking into the political journalistic and
other heavy machinery that is used to sway people. Particularly at the first
Iraq war (about Kuwait), and swaying public opinion to the side of the US.
Especially fascinating is the "Naira" girl who cried wolf, who claimed to be a
Kuwaiti refugee suffering in Iraqi camps, but was actually a member of the
Kuwaiti royal family. Especially interesting is the chain of money and influence
and PR firms that takes that sort of inflammatory material and inject it into
peoples' minds.  Remember "Free Kuwait" t-shirts? Courtesy of Hill and Nolton, a
PR firm which was fed this information.</p>

<p>Astroturfing - creating fake grassroots movements that are actually sponsored by
some corporation</p>

<p>Logical follow up or supplement to The Century of the Self.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lebeau: the crowd is lacking reason, influenced by emotion, images.</li>
<li>Trotters: herd instinct, and group identity is key.</li>
<li>Lippmann: anti democratic conclusion that experts should run the show, not unwashed masses. regain critical faculties by understanding how PR works. also regulatory moves to make public deception illegal.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Soft vs. hard nudging</em>. fundamentally people don't always know what is best for
them, and government can step in. seatbelt laws force you to wear seat belts
always (hard paternalism). GPS navigation systems don't force you to take their
route, cigarette packs with graphic images: soft paternalism.</p>

<p><em>Shoving will backfire</em>: if people feel nudged, they nudge back. U.K. had a test
which gave job seekers a strength profile that was bogus. OIRA branch of the US
and sunstein. what does the most good and least harm? regulations like showing
calorie counts in fast food, environmental friendliness of consumer products,
hidden costs in air tickets and credit card fees. good defaults matter too.</p>

<p><em>Reason &gt; nudging</em>: reason based decisions will be more generally effective.
rather than appealing to some auto response, if you can reach the underlying
understanding, you're better off.</p>

<p>Some weaknesses: some parts, especially the ad related section, lists a lot of
studies, but not the strengths of the effect. Also, largely a derivative work,
mainly a summarization of other works: "Thinking Fast and Slow", "The Hidden
Persuaders", "Orality and Literacy".</p>

<p>Strongest part: chapter 5 about politics, etc.</p>

<p><em>Efficacy of arguments</em>: if dealing with people that agree already (eg. DNC to
Democrats), provide a one-sided argument. Otherwise, go both ways. Discrediting
the other POV is effective.</p>

<p>Garvey calls for a kind of thoughtful anger about persuasion. I concur, and this
is what I'm channeling into Catma, for better or worse.</p>

<h2>The Righteous Mind - July 2016 (5/5)</h2>

<p>I discovered The Righteous Mind via <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/evolving-minds">Jon Haidt's conversation with Sam
Harris</a>. I read it while on our Honeymoon, while Sarah was
enjoying another book about morality. It was very romantic! Anyway, some
thoughts on the book:</p>

<p>Haidt presents his argument in three parts. It's well structured, and super well
written:</p>

<ol>
<li>Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second (ie. people's morality is
driven by intuition/gut reactions, and then they are really good at
justifying their position through reasoning)</li>
<li>There's more to morality than harm and fairness (ie. conservatives care about
many other things: authority, loyalty, sanctity -- this is the foundation of
Moral Foundation Theory)</li>
<li>Morality binds and blinds (ie. arguments around group selection, social
cohesion and other benefits of religion and partisanship)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Not moral relativism</em>. In addition to borrowing from anthropology, Haidt
recounts a personal story of his visit to India, and how initial visceral
discomfort eventually transformed into some understanding of the cultural
context he found himself in:</p>

<pre><code>Understanding the simple fact that morality differs around the world, and even
within societies, is the first step toward understanding your righteous mind.
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think that this is moral relativism, but moral descriptivism. Haidt does
not claim that morality <em>ought</em> to differ around the world, simply that it does
differ.</p>

<p><em>Nice analogies</em>: I found the analogy of a small rider (the rational) riding a
large elephant (the intuitive) apt and useful. Sort of like a lizard brain
idea. </p>

<pre><code>The elephant is far more powerful than the rider, but it is not an absolute
dictator.

Under normal circumstances the rider takes its cue from the elephant, just
as a lawyer takes instructions from a client. But if you force the two to
sit around and chat for a few minutes, the elephant actually opens up to
advice from the rider.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Against rationalism</em>: Haidt presents an interesting argument against moral
rationalism. Firstly, he makes a compelling case for religion as something that
increases social capital via group selection, arguing against the New Atheist
view that religion is evil, period, with no redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>Haidt argues for the Humeian view of morality, and against Bentham's utilitarian
and Kant's deontological positions:</p>

<pre><code>As Western societies became more educated, industrialized, rich, and
democratic, the minds of its intellectuals changed. They became more
analytic and less holistic.26 Utilitarianism and deontology became far more
appealing to ethicists than Hume’s messy, pluralist, sentimentalist
approach.
</code></pre>

<p>Haidt finds support for Hume's position, which is that intuition (or sentiment)
comes first, and then reason tries really hard to come up with arguments to
support that position. Haidt's subjects were</p>

<pre><code>Morally dumbfounded — rendered speechless by their inability to explain
verbally what they knew intuitively. These subjects were reasoning. They
were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of
truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions.
</code></pre>

<p><em>On changing minds</em>:</p>

<pre><code>The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with
other people.

If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the
“other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying,
and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. You may not agree,
but you’ll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful
and constructive yin-yang disagreement
</code></pre>

<p>He presents a framework for how this can happen:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0TIx3sN.png" alt="Social intuitionist model" /></p>

<pre><code>Intuitions come first and reasoning is usually produced after a judgment is
made, in order to influence other people. But as a discussion progresses, we
sometimes change our intuitions and judgements.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Against Rawls</em>:</p>

<pre><code>Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people,
times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single
moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges
are variable.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Salient critiques of the left</em>:</p>

<pre><code>If you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not
consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you’re asking for
trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It
explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist
revolutions usually end up in despotism.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Conservative thinkers</em>, like Frederich Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Jerry Muller, and
Edmond Burke.  I ought to read them! Also, distinctions between conservatism and
orthodoxy:</p>

<pre><code>Christians who look to the Bible as a guide for legislation, like Muslims
who want to live under sharia, are examples of orthodoxy. They want their
society to match an externally ordained moral order, so they advocate
change, sometimes radical change.  This can put them at odds with true
conservatives, who see radical change as dangerous
</code></pre>

<p>2016 is a very confusing year. The media appears to have completely lost its
ability to reason about or predict future political outcomes. Trump's
nomination, Brexit, the rise of populism all over the world, appears mysterious
and scary. In my left coast circles, the right is generally portrayed as
either rich and evil, or poor and dumb.</p>

<p>The Righteous Mind provides a more convincing explanation for contemporary
political divisions around differences in morality. Rather than just identifying
low intellect, sheepishness, or fascist tendencies with right leaning populists,
Haidt offers a useful framework for understanding the conservative world view.
This book is a must read for any political observer with any hope for
understanding.</p>

<h2>Must Mankind Repeat History's Great Mistakes (Audio) - July 2016 (3/5)</h2>

<p>Nice insight and guiding theme: international politics is complicated because there isn't really an organization that stands above all nations. Unlike other human endeavors, if a rogue entity misbehaves, there isn't really anyone to go to by default. Each country has its own skin to worry about, and they need to figure out the best strategy.</p>

<p>I liked the concept of the balance of power, presented in 3 versions by the lecturer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simply the distribution of existing power.</li>
<li>The state in which all parties in question have equal power</li>
<li>A tendency for new power entering a conflict to join the weak side in order to avoid a monopoly of power.</li>
</ol>

<p>After one or two theoretical lectures, the course ventured into territory of WW1, the interwar years, and WW2. I found this part to be somewhat less engaging since most of the historical details were review for me, and little of the theory introduced at the beginning was brought into the fold. The last lecture was more interesting, since it tried to apply the theory introduced at the beginning to predict the future. What made it even more interesting is the fact that the lecture was recorded in the early 90s.</p>

<p>The lecturer wasn't very engaging, and I found myself listening to a lot of the lectures without getting much out of them. Additionally, the volume was low and the recording was poor quality, which contributed to my meta objections.</p>

<h2>The man who loved only numbers (4/5) - July 2016</h2>

<p>I really loved this one. It captures perfectly the quirkiness of Erdos, and his
mathematician circles. Much more than a biography, this book popularizes a lot
of incredibly interesting mathematics. It took me back 10 years to my math
undergrad days.</p>

<p>The author does an incredible job of capturing the essence of many complex
mathematical concepts in appealing and entertaining ways. It's instructive to
compare the way this book tackles certain topics to the corresponding Wikipedia
page, which is completely undecipherable by a non-mathematician, and often even
by a mathematician that doesn't work in that domain. That said, I'm  not sure
that this book would be as appreciated by someone without a background in math.
But it may serve as inspiration for a motivated, mathematically-inclined high
school student. I'll find out!</p>

<p>Despite having spent 4 years taking a bunch of math courses,  I learned a lot of
new math from this book, and was reminded by some favorites.</p>

<p>Ramsey Theory: the inevitability of order in large quantities. We barely touched
on Ramsey theory in 4th year Graph Theory, and it seemed really obscure. Not
true! Draw any 5 points on a plane, and as long as 3 of them don't form a line,
you are guaranteed to be able to form a convex quad using them as vertices. Take
any sequence of 101 numbers, and you're guaranteed to find a subsequence of at
least 10 increasing numbers.</p>

<p>Infinite series: a technical subject, but some really incredible results, like
Taylor expansions of e (sum of 1/k!), pi (6 times sum of 1/k^2).</p>

<p>Cantor's analysis of various infinities (alpha numbers): firstly the beautiful
argument about the countability of rational numbers, and then the famous
diagonalization argument which proves that the set of real numbers is a bigger
infinity.</p>

<h2>Mother of All Demos - June 2016</h2>

<p>http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/extra4/sloan/mousesite/1968Demo.html</p>

<p>As a Human Computer Interaction nerd, I feel the need to pay homage to history
of the field. One glaring omission in my education is that I haven't fully
watched "The Demo" where Douglas Englebart shows off the state of the art of
"Man-Computer Interaction" circa 1968. The subject of the demo is NLS (Online
system), which is intended as a synthesis of a bunch of ideas coming from SRI.
It's quite impressive how far we've come, but also how many elements are still
recognizable, and in some cases impressively ahead of their time.</p>

<p>The first ten minutes introduce a series of key concepts that are staples of
desktop computing: the mouse and keyboard, mouse pointers, copy/paste, saving
and loading files, numbered lists. Less mainstream, VI-like features are also
introduced, such as reorderable, heirarchical lists, and folding sections.
Much of what goes on under the hood in NLS reminded me of VIM script and other
similar DSLs. Big focus on expert-oriented power usage.</p>

<p>The Demo heavily alludes to the web, with a lot of provisions for interlinking,
cross referencing, and even an explicit mention of ARPA close to the end of the
demo (Clip 33), which reminds the viewer that this is all pre-Intenet. In
contrast, their (presumably telephone-based) video calling was quite impressive.
The quality of the remote speaker seemed to be about as good (bad?) as
Englebart's. Some collaborative features were quite impressive, with a real-time
cursor sharing scheme which was decades ahead of its time. Others were less
interesting, like leaving a message for other people in a file to "get a
response within minutes".</p>

<p>Some time is spent showing off hardware. Most interestingly is the
<a href="http://dougengelbart.org/firsts/keyset.html">Keyset</a>, which was a 5-key
ancestor of the chorded keyboard, where each key combination (31 in total) led
to a character, and was intended as a one handed keyboard. Also interesting as a
point of comparison was the cutting edge display tech of the time: black and
white CRTs with 15 Hz refresh rates and super high (3 frame) persistence.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the lab behind MOAD was close to my heart, and lives on in R&amp;D
groups I've had the pleasure of being part of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build and try: big focus on prototyping!</li>
<li>Evolutionary: make incremental improvements to a real system, not grand visions.</li>
<li>Eat your own dogfood: use the thing you build, and test it on yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The One Minute Manager - June 2016 (4/5)</h2>

<p>This little book was recommended to me by a ski instructor after a ski lesson at
Squaw.  The man was probably in his 70s, but skied incredibly well, and had a
lot of wisdom to pass on. He was tough, but nice, like a One Minute Manager.</p>

<p>More of a pamphlet than a book, One Minute Manager unfolds as a story about a
young man wanting to learn to be a good people manager. The story makes the
points more vivid, but at its core, there is an interesting and somewhat
surprising strategy outlined for being a good hands off manager. The approach
reminds me a little bit of Christian's management style. There are three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set goals and expectations with the employee, write them down succinctly and
have them ready for review. (This is similar to Google OKRs, and definitely
worthwhile).</li>
<li>Especially early on, look for behaviors that are praise-worthy, and give due
praise honestly and directly. (This seems like a great idea to try on
interns).</li>
<li>Reprimand unwanted behavior as it happens, but emphasize their worth as
people. (This seems quite hard to pull off without being a dick).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Gantenbein by Max Frisch - June 2016 (4/5)</h2>

<p>Gantenbein was recommended to me by a close friend, who said it made a really
big impact on him. It took me a long time to get through this book, and I often
struggled to follow the narrative. The author writes in a very experimental
style, alternating between three different men, all of which are in love with
Lila, a beautiful stage actress. Events that happen don't seem to have
chronology or causation. Sometimes they branch out into multiple futures, other
times you reset in another time, another place, and as another person.  The book
is a set of sketches around these people, more so than a coherent whole. Adding
to the complexity, the narrator himself seems to not be a single person, but
alternates between people. And this smoke and mirrors is explicit. The author
often writes "I imagine...", and the title is more accurately translated "Let's
assume my name is Gantenbein".</p>

<p>I found this book to be a piercing view into human nature. I could relate to
much of what the characters within it struggle with, which made reading it
difficult and slow. Gantenbein, one of the protagonists, decides to pretend to
be blind for his whole life, and builds a relationship with Lila. He wears dark
glasses, which conceal his lie from others. But he himself has to be careful not
to reveal his secret. He can see, but must pretend that he can't, and this leads
to painful allegory on good relationships.</p>

<p>This book was hard to read. I never got into a flow, and ended up reading very
unevenly, often wanting to set it down for a while. But some parts I really
loved, like when one of the characters attends his own funeral. And I was
surprised to, after finishing it, have a feeling that some coherence emerged by
the end. My understanding of this book would benefit from a re-reading, but I
know that this is unlikely to happen.</p>

<h2>Audio lectures: Physics Beyond the Edge - June 2016 (4/5)</h2>

<p>An interesting follow up to what I remember from high school &amp; first year
physics. My guess is that the subject of the class is too basic for those with a
degree in physics, but this is something I should ask Alex! I really liked how
all of the topics flowed into each other. I found this to be somewhat surprising
given Einstein's failed struggle to find some unified theory of everything. This
is probably credit to the lecturer, who, in addition to being a great
instructor, also coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubit</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the class follows Arthur C. Clark's second law:</p>

<pre><code>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a
little way past them into the impossible.
</code></pre>

<p>The lecturer, Benjamin Schumacher, is quite engaging, and starts by breaking
impossibility down in terms of logical, physical and statistical terms. He then
goes into thermodynamics, framing the first and second laws in terms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion#Classification">perpetual motion machines</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the various Demons that show up in this lecture. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon">Maxwell's
demon</a> can control a flap between two chambers to make sure that
eventually all of the molecules end up in one of the chambers (thus decreasing
entropy). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon">Laplace's demon</a> is able to, from knowing the current state
of the world, predict the future perfectly. Both of these thought experiments
are forays into the impossible that, when disproven, set the stage for the third
law of thermodynamics and chaos / quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The section on space-time was fascinating, and served as a good introduction to
space-time diagrams (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram">Minkowski diagrams</a>), which I really liked.
Although, one thing that was missing is the visual element. Although very
lightweight in mathematical treatment, there were clearly some materials that
supplemented the lectures, which would have made learning easier. The whole
discussion on faster-than-light travel, time travel, and quantum cloning was
tied together nicely through the lens of the impossible. By the way, space-time
diagrams seem to be the reason for this <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/25460/can-we-see-all-of-the-observable-universe">observable universe
thing</a>.</p>

<p>Which brings us to Quantum. I've been interested in being interested in the
topic for a while because it's so unintuitive and strange. Schumacher's
overview is good, but I'm obviously still very confused. He outlines basics of
Quantum Mechanics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wave-particle duality: light has both wave and particle like behaviors.</li>
<li>Uncertainty: position and momentum of a quantum particle cannot both be
known.</li>
<li>Tunneling: because of this uncertainty, quantum particles can tunnel through
what in newtonian mechanics are inpenetrable barriers.</li>
</ol>

<p>There seem to be some fundamental truths about symmetry as pertaining to
conservation laws. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem">Noether's theorem</a> seems remarkably deep but way
over my head, which states that every symmetry in physics has some associated
conservation law.</p>

<p>I was also somewhat lost in the information theory asides (the lecturer's
specialty is information theory). That information theory is a branch of physics
at all is mysterious to me. Probably worth learning more about, though, given my
information-related profession.</p>

<h2>Audio lectures: Great Ideas of Philosophy - May 2016 (5/5)</h2>

<p>Really great series of 60 lectures – that's 24 hours worth as an overview of
philosophers and their main points. I took very few sporadic notes, as the
majority of my listening was done while riding a bicycle. Here are some of my
favorite philosophers and their quotes:</p>

<p>Thomas Reid's [principle of credulity][]:</p>

<pre><code>If no proposition that is uttered in discourse would be believed, until it
was examined and tried by reason … most men would be unable to find reasons
for believing the thousandth part of what is told them. Such distrust and
incredulity would deprive us of the greatest benefits of society.
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120204195817/http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pom/pom_behaviourism_wittgenstein.htm">Wittgenstein's beetle</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Imagine, he says, that everyone has a small box in which they keep a beetle.
However, no one is allowed to look in anyone else’s box, only in their own. Over
time, people talk about what is in their boxes and the word “beetle” comes to
stand for what is in everyone’s box.
</code></pre>

<p>Everything about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a>. This is a treasure trove to be revisited.</p>

<pre><code>The unexamined life is not worth living.
</code></pre>

<p>The stoic mindset, especially this quote attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus">Epictetus</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned it."
</code></pre>

<p>Kant's [Categorical Imperative][kant], in a few formulations:</p>

<pre><code>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that
it should become a universal law without contradiction.
</code></pre>

<p>...and</p>

<pre><code>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in
the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at
the same time as an end.
</code></pre>

<p>and...</p>

<pre><code>Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim
always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.
</code></pre>

<p>And closely related, Rawls' <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/">Original Position</a>, although the lecturer
<a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/great-ideas-of-philosophy-2nd-edition.html">Daniel N. Robinson</a> is surprisingly dismissive of his ideas.</p>

<p>Karl Popper's ideas around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsification</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Falsifiability or refutability of a statement, hypothesis, or theory is the
inherent possibility that it can be proven false. A statement is called
falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which
negates the statement in question. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with
nullify, meaning to invalidate or "show to be false".
</code></pre>

<p>The debate between realism and anti-realism: whether or not scientific theory
describes what the world is actually like, or if it just serves as a nice model.
A succinct summary of the two positions:</p>

<pre><code>Realists see scientific inquiry as discovery while anti-realists sees it as
invention.
</code></pre>

<p>Clarence Irving Lewis and the idea of qualia, especially well illustrated in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument">"Mary's room"</a>, which produces an interesting anti-materialist argument:</p>

<pre><code>The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective
picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller
knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes
set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.
</code></pre>

<p>After nearly 24 hours of lecturing, Daniel synthesizes a lot of philosophical
thought into what constitutes a good life:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fatalism: being OK with your fate.</li>
<li>Hedonism: the good kind, aiming to increase long term pleasure.</li>
<li>Selflessness: benevolent, philanthropic behavior</li>
<li>Activity: don't become a brain in a vat :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to fail at almost everything and still win big by Scott Adams - April 2016 (1/5)</h2>

<p>Let's be clear: this is a self help book. I somehow got suckered into reading it
because I liked one of his blog posts. There are very few interesting or
original things in the book, and the author comes off as brash and trying too hard
to be funny. That said, I liked some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Systems vs goals. Focusing on achievement leads to emptiness after the fact.
Instead focus on a system and process. </p></li>
<li><p>Simplifiers vs optimizers is an interesting dichotomy. Usually it's about
optimizers vs satisficers but in this case I can see myself as a simplifier. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't listen to friends and family feedback on business ideas. Listen to the market. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the rest of the book can be reduced to common sense: eat well, exercise
daily. Some of Scott's specific advice is really uninspired and downright
depressing. He insists that you should learn to play golf, learn a second
language, how to use proper English grammar, how to be outgoing, a good
conversationalist and a public speaker. He devotes a chapter of the book to
learning a special command voice in order to manipulate people better. Move
along!</p>

<h2>art of tidying by Marie Kondo - April 2016 (3/5)</h2>

<p>An endearing manual for tidying up. I'm naturally inclined to minimalism as it stands and did a massive cleanup of my old room in my parents house just last month so consider myself proficient. But Marie takes it to the next level, revealing an autistic inclination towards the personification of inanimate objects. </p>

<p>This manifesto can easily be reduced to an illustrated one pager, but Marie insists on treading over the same ground multiple times. </p>

<ol>
<li>Discard everything you don't need by determining if it sparks joy. Go by category, starting with clothes, moving on to books and personal items. </li>
<li>Once you've donated garbage bags full of items, organize them so that everything you own has a place. Stand everything including clothes vertically. </li>
</ol>

<p>By the end if the book I was curious more about Marie's eccentricity than her organizational method. </p>

<h2>The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris - March 2016 (4/5)</h2>

<p>In many ways a rehashing of many ideas in philosophy, I think Sam did a good job
of bringing some longstanding ideas and debates to the fore without requiring a
degree in philosophy. The section on religion can be skipped, since he rehashes
old theses from End of Faith (oh yeah, hobby horse!)</p>

<p>The overall thesis is that the well being of conscious entities is of supreme
importance, and that morality is all about optimizing that. Intuitively, I agree
that this is a good, pragmatic, and secular definition. I am less interested in the
philosophical debate around it, but I don't think Sam adequately addresses the
other side of the argument adequately. Debates between utilitarian ideas and
other branches of philosophy have been raging for centuries, and with all due
respect, I don't think Sam is the guy to put them to rest.</p>

<p>Despite well being's illusive nature, Sam draws a parallel to health, which is
also difficult to pin down precisely. While the analogy is illustrative, health
is easier to define, and has been done out of practical necessity with metrics
like QALYs. Though flawed, a QALY-like metric that includes all aspects of well
being seems out of reach in 2016.</p>

<p>With that said, Sam hedges heavily against this reality, and repeatedly says
that we may not know what the best collective course of action is, but that one
(or in fact many) must surely exist. These many local minima are the peaks of
The Moral Landscape.</p>

<h2>A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter m. Miller Jr - February 2016 (5/5)</h2>

<p>Amazing. </p>

<p>Q masterpiece in three parts. The setting is post apocalyptic earth after a mutually assured nuclear destruction scenario occurred in the 20th century. </p>

<p>While most of humanity has undergone the simplification, a small order of Christian monks is dedicated to preserving human civilization. Their patron saint, St. Leibowitz, an engineer from before The Deluge. After a bomb shelter with his blueprint is discovered by a primitive monk, a religious scandal unfolds, reminiscent of what might have happened in the dark ages to Galileo. </p>

<p>Many centuries later the blueprint is finally understood by a scientist frustrated by a lack of truly novel discoveries. And an engineer from the same order builds it. It is a simple electrical generator which powersq a lamp. </p>

<p>Eventually humanity returns to its pre Deluge level of technology and surpasses it, achieving the ability to travel to exoplanets. But political strife is once again at an alarming level. And as earth nears nuclear annihilation again, the order of leibowitz prepares to preserve the blueprints and other critical documents and send them, along with a small order of monks, to another planet for resettlement. </p>

<p>The characters are vividly painted, and the historical projection of the dark ages onto a modern technological background is fascinating and masterfully crafted. The book serves as a stark reminder that there is no natural progression toward better  times, and just how fragile our current paradise is. </p>

<p>The threat of nuclear war may feel like a bygone but I'm quite concerned about it still. </p>

<h2>In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays by Bertrand Russell (4/5) - December 2015</h2>

<p>Fascinating collection of essays. In "In praise of idleness", Russell in 1930 predicts that automation will reduce the working day drastically. If your quota of 1000 buttons can be fulfilled in 1/10th the time, you should have a lot more time for pursuing your hobbies. Unfortunately this never happened. </p>

<p>In one of the essays, he declares himself as a socialist while simultaneously distancing from marx, and Russian communism. Essentially he lays groundwork for social democracy. His views on socialism are very reasonable and still relevant today. </p>

<h2>Gateway by Frederik Pohl (4/5) - December 2015</h2>

<p>Humanity discovers an advanced civilization, which has become extinct, but has
left a mysterious Gateway in our solar system. Gateway is a small world which
houses many ships capable of taking adventurers on missions to undisclosed
locations. The controls are cryptic, but slowly residents of gateways gain a
better understanding of how they work. Gateway is controlled by a conspicuously
evil trans-national corporation, which pays prospectors to take dangerous trips
on these ships with the  in hopes of discovery. They pay out lucrative bonuses.</p>

<p>The protagonist, an unsympathetic, and cowardly Robinette (aka Bob), comes to
gateway to try to strike it rich. He struggles with his own fears of going on
missions, and falls in love with Klara. Their dysfunctional relationship, his
troubled childhood, and pathological fear is woven deeply into the structure of
the book. Chapters alternate between Bob's memories on Gateway and Bob the rich
ex-prospector getting therapy sessions from a sentient Robo-psychoanalyst on
Earth. Bob's last mission ends in disaster, as he is separated from his beloved
as their ships try to escape from a black hole. Bob returns the sole survivor,
gets an inordinate amount of money from the corporation, but remains forever
unhappy, missing Klara and suffering from immense guilt.</p>

<p>Overall I liked the book. It was well written and captivating, reminding in some
ways of Robert Heinlein, but maybe a bit more dystopian. There were many
familiar tropes such as a very inter-ratial cast with exotic combinations of
first and last names, like Dane Metchnikov. Bob's adventures with hot space
babes are also I think a hallmark of this style of science fiction. I also
enjoyed Pohl's excerpts of Gateway public announcements, mission reports and
classifieds littered throughout the book.</p>

<h2>Sophie's World by Jostein Gaardner (5/5) - November 2015</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed this one. Clearly a novel for kids, this book provides a nice
overview of philosophy. However it is also quite entertaining. Events center
around Sophie and her mysterious philosophy teacher. Initially I was
disappointed, since it read like a philosophy class given to the reader through
letters sent to Sophie, but as the plot thickened, the format changed to
socratic dialog.</p>

<p>After a somewhat dry start, it is revealed that in fact the author is himself a
fictional character writing a book to her daughter, which reveals a lot of the
strangeness that happens in Sophie's World. Towards the end, her world becomes
increasingly exciting and fantastical, with cameos from more and more strange
fictional characters including Nils and the wild geese. And then it unravels,
when Sophie's fictional philosophy teacher reveals to everyone in their world
that they are living inside a fiction book. This self-referential trick reminds of
Borges and Hofstadter.</p>

<p>I was quite impressed that the Gaardner was able to fit a full intro to
philosophy course into a relatively short book, and still make it entertaining.
It passed my bar with flying colors and I'm keen to give it to Ben. It can be
his high school philosophy class!</p>

<h2>Audio lectures: the United States and the Middle East (3/5) - October 2015</h2>

<p>A historical account of modern middle eastern history from a US lens. Covers the
period between the late Ottoman Empire and September 11th, 2001 and its
aftermath.</p>

<p>I found the course illuminating, with some clarity on various infighting
rivalries within the Muslim world. Also a recap of Israeli history through an
Arab lens was interesting to hear along with additional details on all of the
major wars and their historical impact. I really liked the late 20th century
lens on US presidents as well: fascinating to view it through the middle eastern
lens. </p>

<p>The lecturer is quite biased toward the Arab states, which is not a stance I am
used to. At the same time it is clear he tries to moderate himself to better
appeal to a wider liberal audience. The argument that Israel and American
imperialism is largely to blame for problems in the Middle East runs deeply
through the lecturers narrative. And I suppose that this stance is not so
controversial among liberals too!</p>

<p>Often citing nuances like the definition of Jihad, and underplaying ideological
opposition in favor of external factor mentality, the lecturer makes his bias
very clear in parts. The continuous emphasis on the Israeli occupation gets old
fast. But his stance is not so extreme that he denies that there are genuinely
endemic problems, such as bitter infighting, a general reluctance of the Arab
world to come to the aid of the Palestinian cause, and homegrown (i.e. Not
created by the us) terrorists like Osama bin Laden and organizations like Hamas,
though he never actually calls it a terrorist organization. </p>

<p>Anyway mixed feeling at the end, since too many of my thoughts were wasted on
decomposing the lecturers bias and not enough spent to process the actual
content. Also the speaking cadence made it quite hard to listen to. Ended up
going to 1.5x by the end, which I rarely do. </p>

<h2>Science and Human Values (3/5) - September 2015</h2>

<p>Broznowski tries really hard to impress with his breadth of knowledge. He
constantly drops references to art, literature and philosophy to make his point.
It's as if he is using himself as an example of a scientist who is also well
versed in liberal art (there are dozens of us!!). I found most of the writing to
be very fluffy, deliberately convoluted, and kind of annoying. I had a hard time
finishing despite it being such a short read. I set the book down for a month,
and returned to it later (upon returning from vacation).</p>

<p>In the first part, Broznowski makes the argument that science isn't in and of
itself good or evil, but just a tool. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he
attributes not to the invention of the atomic bomb, but to the politicians that
chose to use it. Seems like a pretty basic argument, but also flawed and not
new. Not being well versed in the philosophy of Science, not in a good position
to judge it.</p>

<p>In the third and final essay, Broznowski considers science as a social
institution, and compares it to the rest of society. This part I thought was
interesting.  Science has many attractive, democratic properties that I agree
could really stand to be ported into other human domains.</p>

<h2>Thinking Fast and Slow (5/5) - September 2015</h2>

<p>An excellent read. Kahneman basically summarizes his career as a psychologist,
in which he systematically found flaws in human ability to think rationally.
He's a founder of behavioral economics, which describes the ways in which humans
make systematic thinking errors (deviating from "pure" rationality)..</p>

<h2>Audio: Skeptic's Guide to American History (4/5) - August 2015</h2>

<p>Well done overview of American History with a historiographical twist. Reminded
me of Mr. Begin's history classes, but probably a little more sophisticated. I
really liked the lecturer's call to skepticism which rang throughout, as he
questioned theme after theme of cliche Americanisms. I really liked his spiral
model of historical progress, and also the fact that he dropped enough
references that I now have plenty of follow up work to do. A worthwhile course
for any non-American. Buy it on <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-skeptic-s-guide-to-american-history.html">TTC</a>.</p>

<h2>Digital Signal Processing Coursera (3/5) - Finished in July 2015</h2>

<p>https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004/</p>

<p>Professors Martin Vetterli &amp; Paolo Prandoni give an in-depth introduction to
digital signals, filtering, etc. A caveat: I only went through the first 10 (out
of 18) days of lectures, and did only some of the homework assignments.</p>

<p>Initially spurred on by a broad interest in music, audio, and sensor processing,
this course served as a very solid theoretical foundation.  The course starts
off with a very dry, theoretical exploration into Hilbert spaces, which served
as an excellent reminder that I can still sort of understand and enjoy
mathematics. However my somewhat pathetic mathematical abilities were stretched
to their absolute limit by Vetterli's systematic barrage of theory, and I would
have surely given up on day 2 if not for some of those upper year linear algebra
classes (thanks UBC!).</p>

<p>The lecture's first focus is on <strong>how to understand signals</strong>. Still shaky on
some of the theory, the lecture delves deep into the theory of fourier analysis
and the formal definition of the discrete fourier analysis and various related
methods like the DTFT. The treatment of the subject is so dry, it's hard to
breathe. Until as if in a sudden rainstorm, the theoretical desert can breathe
again when finally they bring up examples of the STFT, which I have been using
for a while for various audio-related applications at work, without knowing what
it was called.</p>

<p>The next big subject is <strong>transforming signals</strong>, or signal processing.  Here,
the professors introduce LTIs formally, and derive the idea that an impulse
response fully characterizes an LTI. Next they dive into simple filters, FIRs
and IIRs, covering various types of averages, discussing filter stability and
other formal properties. They try to build some intuition about filters from a
frequency-domain perspective, which is very useful to me. Lastly, the subject of
ideal filters is explored, as well as why such filters cannot be implemented in
real life. </p>

<p>Finally, they discuss how to actually design filters using the z-transform,
whose derivation remains somewhat mysterious to me, which is unfortunately
normal for an engineering course. Prandoni gives a good interpretation for the
pole-zero plot, which is a really elegant way of looking at filters. The lecture
turns practical for a brief moment, when they reveal that implementations
already exist for non-ideal versions of many of these filters and explore a few
differences between Butterworth, Chebyshev and Elliptic low pass filters. They
also talk about FIRs, and I finally understand the jargon of 'taps', which I
just heard about at a lecture held at Noisebridge.</p>

<p>I still struggle to convert block diagrams into equations, but feel like I have
a much better sense of second order IIRs that ship with the Web Audio API.
Overall a mathematically challenging, but interesting class.  I really wish
there was a better way to build intuition for a lot of the theory, though.</p>

<h2>Audio: Understanding the Secrets of Human Perception (4/5) -- June 2015</h2>

<p>http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/understanding-the-secrets-of-human-perception.html</p>

<p>Excellent overview of perception. I learned a ton from these lectures, and
really want to enumerate all of the illusions and experiments that the lecturer
cites which give insight into the way our senses work. Lots of in-depth material
about our visual system, how we percieve motion, the incredible variety of depth
cues, as well as after-images and color effects. Some senses, like audition,
were largely review for me, but others, like olfaction and taste were completely
new to me. Multi-modal perception gets especially interesting, the canonical
illusion being the McGurk effect, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisensory_integration#Multisensory_illusions">there are many more</a>.</p>

<p>This course is much more than just enumerated sensory illusions, though.  The
great thing about it is that Vishton spends a fair amount of time on the general
principles of operation of our brains, from fundamentals of neurons and synapses
to opponent-process theory, which explains a great deal of perception phenomena
across the senses. From a UX and VR perspective, the material in this course is
totally invaluable. </p>

<h2>John Napier - Hands (4/5) -- May 2015</h2>

<p>Really interesting deep-dive into human hands from many different perspectives:
anatomical, evolutionary, functional and social. The book is packed with facts.
For example, I had no idea the carpal bones were so numerous and complex! Also,
it's nice to understand why human opposition differs from monkeys and the
Opposability Index. Lots of interesting insights into distribution of
handedness, including that certain species of monkeys are predominantly left
handed, which is surprising on several levels. Napier also goes a bit into
fingerprints, basic patterns, and mentioning some relation to worn-off finger
prints in people with Celiac. It was fun to cross-correlate what was written in
the book with my own hands.</p>

<p>Overall a thoroughly interesting account and I found good insights from an HCI
perspective. I did think that the second part on social and cultural aspects was
too brief and incomplete.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the eye, the hand is our main source of contact with the physical environment. The hand has advantages over the eye because it can observe the environment by means of touch, and having observed it, it can immediately proceed to do something about it. The hand has other great advantages over the eye. It can see around corners and it can see in the dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Vernor Vinge (2/5) - Rainbow's End -- April 2015</h2>

<p>Real science fiction, in a bad way, focusing more on the science than the
fiction, Asimov style. Not that great of a book, underdeveloped characters,
contrived plot. Really felt like it was written by a technologist, unlike say
Bashert by my former CS professor. The main reason I read it was for is focus on
VR, but even for that I got bored about half way through and had to force myself
to finish.</p>

<p>The library allegory felt too obvious, as if the author was just shoving the out
with the old, in with the new in your face.</p>

<h2>Blue Mind (3/5) -- March 2015</h2>

<p>The message was good and clear, but the writing was tedious. Like Gladwell
books, this one could be compressed to a short pamphlet. I liked the distinction
between hedonism and eudaimonia, which was a very ancillary point in the book,
but still new to me. I also liked the blue marble finish. But the meat of the
book consists of an glorified enumeration of activities related to water.</p>
