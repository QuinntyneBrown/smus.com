Solid 2014 notes

## Nadya Peek: making machines that make

- Manufacturing tools suck.
- From the center for bits and atoms.
- FabLab: a standard-ish library for various digital manufacturing equipment.
- Showing lots of interesting 3D printers and variants.
- Seems to be arguing for "virtual fab machine" concept
  - Abstracts out a bunch of machine implementation details.
  - Works across a bunch of different machines.


## Astro Teller: justifying Google[x]

- Google wants to solve big problems.
- Many problems cannot be solved with software alone.
- Green-field problems: company big enough to explore problems others haven't touched.


## Hiroshi Ishii: talking about his lab

- Vision (100 years) => Applications (~10 years) => Technologies (~1 year)
- Example: how many listen to music on LP/CD/Mp3/Streaming?
- Lab vision: GUI => TUI => Radical Atoms (mostly in physical world)
- Showing research from 1999 "Urp: Urban Planning Workbench"
- Shape displays. "TimeScape", "inFORM"

    Don't ask why; this is art.

- Latest clip: multiple inFORM tables side-by-side.
- "What do you want to leave for those living in 2200"?


## ????

- Claim: your next household robot will be your house.
- Fully automated dairy farms (wow?)
  - Robotic milking.
  - Automated back scratchers, herders, feed pushers, teat inspectors, pasture selectors, etc.
- (Boris): are people like cows?


## Kipp Bradford: serial hardware entrepreneur guy

- Bone cell as a factory for generating ceramic composites (bone)
- Bones as repeating units.
- Backing up further, skeletal system has emerging properties.
- Scaling discontinuities.
  - Facebook: through scale, get all social information in one place.
  - Fedex: through scale, make shipping super efficient.
- Claim: bitcoin will be the next thing to transform banking.


## Tobias from Bot & Dolly

- DEC founder: "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home".
- MS founder: "A PC on every desk in every home".
- Claim: robotics is at the same breaking point.
- Bot & Dolly: a design consultancy focusing on robotics.
  - Building a lot of robots for cinema purposes.
  - Gravity: built a robotic room that moves around the actor.
- Lots of really cool demo videos...
  - Music: compose by moving a robot through space.
  - Architecture: "Stack" precisely positions wooden planks.
  - Photography: system for real time capture & repeat.
  - Cinema: "Box" robot arm that moves the scene around to look like magic.


## Ivan Popurev

- At Sony, made gadgets for 8 years.
- The whole world is becoming a gadget.
- "How can we make the entire world interactive"?
- At Disney, the world was Disney World.
- Lesson 1: give non-invasive senses to the world.
  - Demo of Touche.
  - Demo of capacitative touch on a plant.
- Lesson 2: generate power locally.
  - Demo of the work from UIST 2013.
  - Demo of Aireal (pushes air through haptic projectors)


## Jim Stogdill (O'Reilly)

- Emerging from weblandia... (20 years of computing being confined to the web)
- A bit of history:
  - James Watt: building a steam engine (Industrial Revolution)
  - Vint Cerf: building a packet switcher (Internet)
  - ???: building an internet of connected devices (???)


## 6D Pose Tracking for VR

- VR: for a sense of presence.
- First Oculus had 3-DOF, next one has 6-DOF.
- Challenges: precision & latency
- IR LEDs, wideview (80deg x 64deg) IR camera & IMU @ 1 KHz.
- Fuse camera and IMU to extract position.
- Emit markers via IR LEDs, camera finds them, and tries to reconstruct the scene.
- RANSAC: Random Sample Consensus. 
- Iterative pose estimation (users don't move much frame-to-frame)
- Tracking quality precision: 0.05mm @ 1.5m.

? So it doesn't work unless you're facing a wall...?


## Matthew Gardiner: folding = coding for matter


## Organ maker guy

- Discussing history of Organs.
- What's changed in 150 years of organ building? Very little :)
- Organs moved to magnetic principle for action.
- Charles Fisk, founder of company, switched the company back to original valve action.
  - Charles started as a nuclear physicist, switched to Organ building.

## Dragon Innovation

- The company does some sort of consulting for hardware startups.
  - Could be good for SmartBells?
- CrowdFunding: "Sell then Build"
- Manufacturing is hard.
- BOM: plastic, parts, electric comps, consigned, deco, packaging, labor, etc, etc.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't do a hardware startup :)

- SmartBells should be about software.
- Built using a prototype hardware, but the hardware is interchangeable.


## Designing tech for women as early adopters

- Women tell other women (virality).
- Broader picture view of the world.
 (zoned out)


## Mike Kuniavsky

Chippendale furniture ubiquitous.
Famous for "director", a book with furniture designs.
Calling for a high level physical/digital description language.
Somewhat like FabLab.


## Greg Borenstein: Camera as the ultimate sensor
