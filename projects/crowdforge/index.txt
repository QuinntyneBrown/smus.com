Mechanical Turk is great for accomplishing small, well defined nuggets
of work, (eg. labeling images), but terrible for many more complex and
labor intensive real world tasks. Invented CrowdForge, a
MapReduce-inspired framework for breaking down complex tasks into
smaller sub-tasks. Presented at UIST 2011.
