      <p>Today's web is still fundamentally a series of interlinked hypertext
documents. But web pages in virtual reality are as out of place as a
terminal emulator windows in a graphical user interface. Both are windows
into a very different world. So what is the hypertext equivalent for
Virtual Reality?</p>

<h2>Photosphere as primitive</h2>

<p>The screens we interact with are fantastic at rendering text.  And, a
lot of the time you spend on your devices is spent reading: emailing,
texting and chatting, reading ebooks, blogs, the news.  Of course, the
web allows for a much richer media experience through embedded content,
that's the "hyper" part of hypertext (more on that later). Even though
it's hyper, it's still mostly just text!</p>

<p>While you're reading this post on your device, you are immersed in text.
But turn off your screen and step outside (really, I recommend it), and
you'll see that text is a very small part of what you see. Our goal here is
to create something that is fitting for virtual <strong>reality</strong>, so we need
something that better represents the real world. Text cannot be the
underlying substrate.</p>

<p>What, then, is the "minimum viable" substrate for virtual reality? How
about the photosphere! Rather than text pages, the basis of a VR web
page can be a photosphere of absolutely anything. It might be something
that is captured <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-sphere-camera/id904418768?mt=8">using your smartphone</a>, like one I
took at an <a href="http://photovrse.com/?url=http://photovrse.com/examples/anechoic.vrse">Anechoic Chamber</a> at Google, or using
specialized hardware like the <a href="https://theta360.com/en/">Ricoh Theta</a>, which I took inside
my <a href="http://photovrse.com/?url=http://photovrse.com/examples/car.vrse">amazing car</a>. It might even be something from a virtual
environment like these <a href="http://photovrse.com/?url=http://photovrse.com/examples/tiled.vrse">in-game photospheres</a>.</p>

<p>Add a separate image for your other eye, and you have a stereo
photosphere suitable for consumption in VR. Animate the image and
suddenly you are in a stereo 360 videosphere.</p>

<h2>Hyper-photospheres</h2>

<p>Just like text, the photosphere can be enriched with other types of
media on top: images, video, audio, and even textual annotations. This
mars photosphere has several images embedded in it:</p>

<p><a href="http://photovrse.com/?url=http://photovrse.com/examples/mars.vrse"><img src="annotated.jpg" alt="An annotated
photosphere" /></a></p>

<h2>This is what makes the web great</h2>

<p>Just like hypertext, hyper-photospheres can enjoy all of the benefits of
the web. You can link from one photosphere to other places in the
photovrse. You can also embed photospheres in regular pages, as in this
example:</p>

<p><a href="http://photovrse.com/embed"><img src="embed.jpg" alt="A mars photosphere embedded inside a fake New York Times article" /></a></p>

<p>Last but not least, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate</a>, you can view these
photospheres on any device. It works on desktop, with or without an
Oculus Rift, on mobile in a magic window by default, or in VR if you
have a Cardboard headset. Both Android and iOS are supported.</p>

<h2>The photovrse prototype</h2>

<p>All of the photospheres mentioned above were shown using PhotoVRSE, a
hyper-photosphere browser implemented using WebGL. Project is <a href="https://github.com/borismus/photovrse">hosted on
GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Each photosphere is represented as JSON, in a <code>.vrse</code> file. You can make
your own hyper photosphere by just creating and hosting a <code>.vrse</code> file
anywhere on the web. Here are the contents of an example
file hosted at <a href="http://photovrse.com/examples/mars.vrse">http://photovrse.com/examples/mars.vrse</a>. To render this
or any other vrse file, open it using the photovrse renderer at
<a href="http://photovrse.com/?url=http://photovrse.com/examples/mars.vrse">http://photovrse.com/?url=http://photovrse.com/examples/mars.vrse</a>.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "title": "Mars",
  "image": "examples/mars/mars.jpg",
  "preview": "examples/mars/preview.jpg",
  "isStereo": false,
  "audio": "examples/mars/dawn_chorus.mp3",
  "labels": [{
    "phi": 2.36,
    "theta": 0.25,
    "image": "examples/mars/mars_olympus.jpg",
    "title": "Olympus Mons"
  }, {
    "phi": 0.61,
    "theta": -0.11,
    "image": "examples/mars/mars_rover.jpg",
    "title": "The Opportunity Rover"
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see some basic metadata about the photosphere: its title, the
preview image URL and the full URL, whether or not it's stereo, and all
of the labels, their content and titles. This photosphere also contains
a musical loop of ambient sound.</p>

<h2>Label types</h2>

<p>Each label has several mandatory fields: two euler angles in radians
(<code>phi</code> and <code>theta</code>), a <code>title</code> description of the scene, and the content
that it points to. These labels are rendered as distinct green markers,
and on desktop, can be interacted by clicking on them. In general,
however, clicking may not be available, so they can be activated by
gazing at them for a prolonged period.</p>

<p>The following label types are currently supported:</p>

<p><strong>Image labels</strong> show an image overlay.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "phi": 0.61,
  "theta": -0.11,
  "image": "examples/mars_rover.jpg",
  "title": "The Opportunity Rover"
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Link labels</strong> take you to a different photosphere.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "href": "http://photovrse.com/examples/video.vrse",
  "phi": 0,
  "theta": 1
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Back labels</strong> take you back to the previous photosphere. The following
example makes a back link on the floor directly below you.</p>

<pre><code>{
  "back": true
  "phi": 0,
  "theta": -1.5708
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Textures, server-side tiling, stereo and video</h2>

<p>Photospheres are usually huge files, both in bytes and in dimensions. A
typical one generated by the Google Photosphere camera is 5 MB and 7168
x 3584. This presents certain challenges on the web. To view the
photosphere in situ, these large images serve as textures that are
projected onto a sphere.</p>

<p><strong>Previews</strong>: Loading a 5MB file takes some time, so photovrse lets you
provide a smaller, lower quality preview image which can be loaded
quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Texture sizing</strong>: In general, 3D graphics environments have
texture size limits. In WebGL, this size limit can be extracted
programatically, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var gl = canvas.getContext('webgl');
this.maxTextureSize = gl.getParameter(gl.MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE);
</code></pre>

<p>Using very large textures is often problematic, though, and leads to
strange artifacts especially in my testing on iOS. On Android too, I've
found (empirically) that they slow things down. It seems faster to split
textures into chunks using a canvas (see <a href="https://github.com/borismus/photovrse/blob/master/js/image-util.js">ImageUtil</a>) and then load
them into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_trigonometry">spherical triangles</a>. I currently split all textures into
tiles of 1024 x 1024, which seems to do pretty well.</p>

<p>For optimal mipmapping, texture sizes should be a power-of-two, which
means that it's often better to resize the original images to that size.</p>

<p><strong>Server tiling</strong> But chunking images is hard work. Especially if you're
a smartphone. Ideally, we should be able to do this work elsewhere!
I've provided a <a href="https://github.com/borismus/photovrse/tree/master/scripts/tile_image.sh">script to split an image into tiles</a> to do
this. Also, photovrse supports tiled images with the following changes
in the <code>.vrse</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "image": "examples/tiled",
  "isTiled": true,
  "tileDimensions": [4, 8],
}
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than providing a .jpg, you provide a directory which contains
multiple images (in this case 4x8 = 32) in the format
<code>tile_{{row}}_{{column}}.jpg</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Stereo</strong> By convention (there's not much of it yet), stereo
photospheres are stored stacked, with the <a href="http://photovrse.com/examples/stereo/tasha-stereo-2048.jpg">left eye image on top of the
right</a> one. The one test video I saw had the left
rectilinear video on the left, and the right one on the right. It's a
matter of convention and doesn't really matter, but this is the way
photovrse handles it.</p>

<p><strong>Stereo video in iOS</strong> Unfortunately iOS <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29621199/three-js-video-textures-in-ios-play-back-in-a-separately-launched-player-ideas">doesn't support video
textures</a>, since Safari forces all <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements into a
separate native view. So, no stereo video for iOS users yet.</p>

<h2>Visitor gaze tracking</h2>

<p>For prototyping purposes, I've been using Firebase for hosting the
metadata JSON of a photosphere. Of course, the real point of Firebase is
real-time updates, and if multiple people are present in the same
photosphere, we can show where everyone is looking in real time:</p>
