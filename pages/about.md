Hello from the west coast!

My passion is to invent and build enjoyable, useful, and novel user
interfaces at the cusp of hardware and software. I am a proficient
front-end and mobile engineer with experience leading teams. In my
projects, I tend to gravitate to web technologies because of the
flexibility of the web platform. My professional interests include
education, audio and music, sensors and interaction design.

My job at Google is a mix of software engineering and user experience
prototyping. I have had the good fortune to help launch [Google
Cardboard][cardboard], [Google Tone][tone], and build many other exciting
products with a small, fast moving team.

At my previous job as an engineer on the Chrome developer relations team
we pushed the limits of the modern web platform and educated web
developers. I helped launch [Chrome for Android][chrome], [wrote
articles][h5r], [gave talks][talks] and released open source libraries
and samples. I also authored a short [book on the Web Audio API][book].

Before Google, I was a graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon][cmu], where
I focused on social and [wearable computing research][research] and
built [CrowdForge][crowdforge], a system for crowdsourcing complex
tasks. Prior to that, I worked at Apple for two years, contributing to
iWeb, iWork and helping start [iWork.com][iwork]. For the still curious,
my [resume is online][resume].

I am Canadian. I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the
[University of British Columbia][ubc], and spent my formative years in
Vancouver.
