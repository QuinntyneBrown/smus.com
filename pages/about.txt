About the author
================

Hey! I'm most passionate about creating useful, enjoyable user
interfaces (in the broadest sense of the word), especially at the cusp
of hardware and software. In my projects, I tend to gravitate to web
technologies because of the flexibility of the platform.

I'm currently employed as a software engineer working on emerging user
interfaces at Google Research. Prior to that I was on the Chrome
developer relations team, doing my part to bring more awesomeness to the
modern web platform.

Before Google, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University,
where I focused on wearable and social computing research. Prior to
that, I worked at Apple for two years, contributing to iWeb, iWork and
iWork.com.

For a more detailed chronicle, here is my [resume][].
