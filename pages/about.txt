About the author
================

Hey! I'm most passionate about creating useful, enjoyable user
interfaces, especially at the cusp of hardware and software. In my
projects, I tend to gravitate to web technologies because of the
flexibility of the platform.

I'm currently an engineer in research working on new UI paradigms. Prior
to that I was on the Chrome developer relations team, doing my part to
bring more awesomeness to the modern web platform.

Before Google, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University,
where I mostly did HCI research in physical, wearable and social
computing.

I am from Vancouver, Canada and spent my formative childhood years in
St. Petersburg, Russia. For a complete chronicle, here is my [resume][].
