      <p>Lately, I have been dissatisfied with my blogging. My recent posts have been
long and unfocused, presenting many different thoughts without a single clear
message. Why has this happened? One possibility is that Lightning, the static
blog engine I wrote and use needs a bit of an upgrade. As they say in Russian, a
bad dancer blames his balls.</p>

<p>Lightning is awesome for long form content because it lets you gather all of the
assets you want to include in your post together in one directory, place it
alongside the markdown <code>index.md</code>, and put the content out there in a single
bundle. But this does not work well for short form content, since it requires
too much up-front effort:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Decide where to place the new directory. New posts belong in the
<code>content/posts/2017/how-to-fix-the-world</code>. Deciding on this directory involves
navigating to the right place, and deciding on the slug for the post.</p></li>
<li><p>Create the index.md file and write all of the information in the markdown
file, including the human-readable title and the posted date.</p>

</ol>

<p>Then, after writing the post, you have to rename the directory to reflect the
slug since inevitably the title has changed: <code>mv how-to-fix-the-world
how-to-slightly-improve-the-world</code>. Finally I publish and tweet, and hopefully
the world becomes infinitesimally better.</p>

<h2>Split markdown pages</h2>

<p>I wanted to reduce the barrier to writing by just top-posting to an existing
file and have the engine automatically generate a slug based on the title and
split the file into multiple pages. This is the conceptual inverse of
<a href="http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/transclusion.html">MultiMarkdown transclusion</a>, which lets you create extra long articles
from multiple markdown files. I've also refactored <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">Lightning</a> into
classes, making it easier to add features in the future.</p>

<p>Split markdown files power two new sections on <a href="http://smus.com">http://smus.com</a>: a <a href="/books">book
reviews section</a>, and a <a href="/notes">notes section</a>. I'm really hoping that
this will encourage me to write shorter, more focused posts with increasing
frequency. To give a sense of what these split markdown files look like, take a
