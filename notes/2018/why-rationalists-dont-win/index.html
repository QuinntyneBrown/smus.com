  <meta name="description" content="The belief that  "rationalists should win"  is widely held in the rationalist community. So: does being a good rationalist actually help you win? Certainly in some domains, like engineering and science, which focus on quantification, systematization, and prediction. There, having a hyper-rational mindset is clearly an advantage. As for winning at life, which I will take that to mean leading to greater success in survival, evolution, and human flourishing, I don't think rationality helps very much.    The rationalist doctrine always favors quantification and optimization over intuition. From a rationalist perspective, humans are buggy "computers made of meat". We are full of cognitive biases that cloud our judgement, and cause us to do reliably poorly on  simple tasks  related to probability. So even if you don't really know what probability to assign, it's better to  "put a number on it" , and then  "shut up and multiply" .    The problem with the above approach lies with the words "systematic" and "predictable". From Herb Simon's idea of  Bounded Rationality , our human ability to be rational, to systematize and predict is inherently limited. These limitations may come from our limited brains, but may also be fundamental in nature. Chaos theory makes it really difficult for even the most advanced computers to predict even simple systems, such as the position of the double pendulum after a small amount of time.    The world is far more complicated than two attached pendelums, and if we insist on making every decision in life based on a  series of sound logical steps , we may find ourselves paralyzed by the complexity of every single junction. Gerd Gigerenzer's  XXX rationality  suggests that many things that appear illogical are actually done for good reasons, or lead to good outcomes. This idea is directly at odds with the rational propensity for first knowing what is true (epistemic rationality), and then making decisions in a series of logical steps.    Instead of being dogmatic about approaches, we should be consequentialists. We should look at outcomes. Are rationalists more satisfied with their lives than their non-rationalist counterparts? Are they more productive? Do they have fewer regrets? Do they have better relationships? Make more money? Have happier children? Impact their domains of knowledge more effectively?    It may be hard to answer the above questions. Perhaps many people are practicing rationalists but would not self-report as such. On the other hand, self reporting rationalists from the rationalist community may skew in a very specific way. From my (frequent) visits to the Seattle Rationalist meetup, the community has evolved into something that is often more about the friendships than about the practice. Don't get me wrong: it's an incredibly welcoming atmosphere with some really great people, but the rates of social awkwardness, non-traditional lifestyles, and mental problems is high. And I don't know whether or not to attribute this to the practice of rationality itself?    Suppose we had a definitive answer to the above question, and it was clear that in general, Buddhists were happier than other groups, Protestants more productive, Amish more friendly, and Singularitarians more innovative. The instrumentally rational thing to do would be to first clarify to yourself: what does winning mean to you, and then pick the optimal set of beliefs based on expected outcomes their for adherents.    Of course, you want to remain open to changing your mind, so allow yourself to indulge fully your chosen beliefs for a year or so. On January first, wake up late, nurse your hangover, partake in the polar bear plunge, and re-evaluate your beliefs.">

      <p>The belief that <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_is_systematized_winning">"rationalists should
win"</a> is
widely held in the rationalist community. So: does being a good rationalist actually
help you win? Certainly in some domains, like engineering and science, which
focus on quantification, systematization, and prediction. There, having a
hyper-rational mindset is clearly an advantage. As for winning at life, which I
will take that to mean leading to greater success in survival, evolution, and
human flourishing, I don't think rationality helps very much.</p>

<p>The rationalist doctrine always favors quantification and optimization over
intuition. From a rationalist perspective, humans are buggy
"computers made of meat". We are full of cognitive biases that cloud our
judgement, and cause us to do reliably poorly on <a href="Newcomb's
Problem">simple tasks</a> related to probability. So even if you don't really know what
probability to assign, it's better to <a href="putanumonit blog">"put a number on it"</a>,
and then <a href="wherever thats from">"shut up and multiply"</a>.</p>

<p>The problem with the above approach lies with the words "systematic" and
"predictable". From Herb Simon's idea of <a href="">Bounded Rationality</a>, our human
ability to be rational, to systematize and predict is inherently limited. These
limitations may come from our limited brains, but may also be fundamental in
nature. Chaos theory makes it really difficult for even the most advanced
computers to predict even simple systems, such as the position of the double

suggests that many things that appear illogical are actually done for good
