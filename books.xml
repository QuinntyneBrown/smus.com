        <p>Every society operates on very deeply rooted assumptions that are worth
understanding. Watts thinks we can seek wisdom from Chinese and Indian culture
to better understand our own. </p>

<p>Watts is for a holistic view of self without boundaries. We humans have a clear
distinction between the natural (eg. our bodies) and artificial (eg. our houses).
But what about bees? Are bees natural and bee hives artificial? Clearly not.
Watts runs with the boundary-less way of thinking about self and extends it to
limits of our understanding. Watts points to a certain fundamental law of
symmetry. Every coin has heads and tails, every inside has an outside. Waves,
the fundamental unit of animal perception is composed from crests and troughs.
You cannot have one without the other. His ultimate aim here is to try to
eliminate the illusion of self. In this view, there’s no barrier between
yourself and the rest, just a unified whole. </p>

<p>Watts is a big fan of gerunds, and does a good job of taking an outside view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple tree “apples”, meaning it produces apples, and in the same way earth
  “peoples”, producing intelligent humans. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He breaks down various kinds of “why?” Which reminds me of Alex’s post that
in Russian there are at least two words for why: зачем (instrumental: what is it
for?) and почему (epistemic: how is it so?). Watts scoffs at the instrumental
and gravitates towards the epistemic question.</p>

<p>Relatedly, Watts preaches the need for purposelessness as an end in itself. If
you play because it is good for you, you aren’t really playing. Playing has to
be purposeless, like daydreaming or dancing for its own sake. Significance must
be in itself, not for the sake of something else. Great example of Bach and
baroque composers that are satisfying as is without having explicit meaning.
Watts calls for us to embrace nonsense, pointing at Lewis Carroll’s whimsical
“twas brillig...”, babbling choruses in English folk songs (eg. The Corries) and
bopping to Jazz. </p>

<p>He quotes G. K. Chesterton quite a bit, and I enjoyed the quotes he selected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is one thing to look with amazement at gorgon or griffin, a creature that
  does not exist, but it is quite another thing to look at a hippopotamus, a
  creature who does exist, but looks like he does not. – G. K. Chesterton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watts ends with a question: Is human nature flawed as in western
conception? Or is it fundamentally trustworthy and essentially good as in the
Chinese conception? The sentiment “I do not trust nature, it has to be watched”
quickly leads to totalitarianism since you assume the worst in people.</p>

        <p>A sad story about Theranos and it’s leadership, in large part Elisabeth Holmes,
a tragic hero with a fatal flaw: unbridled ambition. </p>

<p>The rest follows: unreasonably high confidence, sweeping major problems under
the rug, and cargo cult worship dedicated to successful leaders. Which includes
setting super high expectations for employees, fostering internal competition,
demanding absolute loyalty and punishing any whiffs of dissent. </p>

<p>What was most surprising to me were the many ethical breaches exhibited by
Holmes herself: mixing business and romance, hiring exclusively political
celebrities to your board, and showing almost no empathy for employees, while
pursuing ruthless legal tactics in personal vendettas. </p>

<p>It’s hard to say how fringe the Theranos story is. I’ve seen some parts in other
Silicon Valley contexts, especially Steve Jobs worship, unreasonable levels of
confidence in executives. And incredible secrecy for questionable reasons. </p>

<p>But some parts of the Theranos story seem more unique, especially given their
specialized domain of health care where I think many startups tread lightly
because of the regulatory environment. Uber may be a good analogy and
counterpoint here, playing hard and fast with regulation and actually
succeeding. The stakes in health care are understandably higher and its probably
a good thing Theranos was ultimately stopped. </p>

<p>The Theranos story may in part be a cautionary tale of digital culture colliding
with physical culture. But it is not helped by a morally compromised leader who
believes that the ends justify the means. </p>

    <title>Darkness at Noon by Arthur Koestler (audio)</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I learned about "Darkness at Noon" from a <a href="/books/reason-in-human-affairs-by-herbert-simon/">Herb Simon
essay</a>, where he praised
emotional story telling as a vehicle for helping people "attend to issues
longer, to think harder about them, to receive deeper impressions that last
longer". He asked: would you rather read "Darkness at Noon", or verbatim
transcripts of Stalin's purges?</p>

<p>The book is historical fiction loosely based on 1930s Soviet Russia. Supposed
counter revolutionary movements are being quashed by Stalin. The "hero",
Nicholas Rubashov finds himself in the middle of absurd Stalinist show trials,
having to publicly admit to crimes he never committed. The intent of his captor
is “to gild the right, to blacken the wrong”, ingraining black and white thinking
into the masses. The means and ends of the current government are good and just
and pure, and everything that opposes it is hellspawn and deserves only one
fate. Despite Rubashov's intention to deliver an impassioned speech
like Danton did before the guillotine, he finds himself powerless against the
Soviet machine, mechanically pleading guilty in the show trial, and then being
put to death.</p>

<p>That isn't to say that Rubashov is innocent. As a younger man fervently
dedicated to the party, he indirectly condemned his own lover to death,
supposedly for the sake of the collective. Now in jail, and softened by sudden
onsets of nuance, the former revolutionary has time to reflect. Intensely
psychological, the book delves into Rubashov's evolution as he realizes that
human life is sacred and no idea is worth sacrificing it for. Rational
mathematics does not apply in this domain, and Rubashov eventually becomes a
humanist. Fundamentally, Koestler's powerful critique of Stalinism is that the
ends do not justify the means.</p>

<p>Late in the book, a distinction between two kinds of suffering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Biological: Inevitable suffering from unmet basic needs.</li>
<li>Social: Avoidable suffering from broken social systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>Koestler observes that Revolution reduces Type 2 suffering but inevitably
increases to Tyle 1 suffering. Was the Russian Revolution justified? When is
revolution ever justified?  Through Rubashov, he wrestles with this issue,
acknowledging the need for social change, but questioning the means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One cannot heal a person mortally ill by pious exhortations. The only solution
  was the surgeon's knife and his cool calculation. But wherever the knife had
  been applied, a new sore had appeared in place of the old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really liked this book. Not having read the transcript of Stalin's purges, I
am going to assume that Herbert Simon was right: Darkness at Noon is well
written, interesting, and visceral.</p>

        <p>Buckminster Fuller's name seems to pop up everywhere in the last few years. I
saw Jonathon Keats talk at The Interval a few years ago, on a book tour about
Fuller's life and work. I finally got to listen to the audio version. I found
bits to be interesting, but overall this book is less of a biography, and more
of an attempt to riff on various modern incarnations of Fuller's ideas. Fuller
himself comes off as overly self-involved. His investment and belief in panacea
projects like the World Game, Domed Manhattan, Dymaxions comes off as overly
naive for such a great man.</p>

<p>The book itself is interesting but not groundbreaking. It involves overly
flowery descriptions of things that I consider obvious: Google, Nest, Sim City,
self driving cars, etc. The end appears especially weak. The author spends too
much time on platitudes about specialization. If I had a dollar for every time
he wrote “comprehensive anticipatory design science”...</p>

<p>Leads from the book:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wikihouse.cc/">Wikihouse</a>: simple, sustainable, open building
technologies.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/mooc-pre-history">Sunrise Semester</a> was an early morning CBS program that offered NYU courses for credit to viewers, precursor of MOOCs. Thousands of people participated.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/green-float/">Green Float</a> is a
proposed floating city concept developed by Shimizu Corporation of Japan.</li>
<li>Lewis Mumfort's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Machine">Pentagon of Power</a> criticizes planned cities as
anti-cities, and Bucky's <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/863">Tetrahedron City project</a> as “A pyramid big
enough to entomb the population of a while town”.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shigerubanarchitects.com/works/2013_CCC/index.html">Shigeru Ban</a> designed some cardboard-based buildings for refugees,
from practical dwellings to cathedrals. Impressive!</li>
<li>One of Fuller's collaborators, critiques domes as <a href="http://www.domerama.com/general/smart-but-not-wise/">"smart but not
wise"</a>, a quip that is often applicable to modern tech. Specifically:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metaphorically, our work on domes now appears to us to have been smart: mathematics, computers, new materials, plastics. Yet reevaluation of our actual building experiments, publications, and feedback from others leads us to emphasize that there continue to be many unsolved problems with dome homes. Difficulties in making the curved shapes livable, short lives of modern materials, and as-yet-unsolved detail and weatherproofing problems.</p>

    <title>Unsong by Scott Alexander</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Unsong is based on a really compelling concept. As it turns out, the Torah is
literally true. God is real, angels and demons literally control the fate of the
world. Kaballah is indeed the fundamental way that the universe works. Some
people continue to irrationally cling to their old beliefs (Science, Pluralism)
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Earth is the center of the
Universe, and when Apollo 11 launched, it crashed into the firmament and left a
gaping hole in it. </p>

<p>Alexander's novel excels at world building. The back story to how the world came
to be is fascinating. Unsong is full of gullible archangels and clever
Kaballists-programmers, San Francisco is Jerusalem, magical incantations possess
true powers and a righteous police force enforces their usage. These are all
super creative components of the complex universe conjured from thin air.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite the awesome concept, Unsong is not well executed. The
storyline is dull, the characters all speak in one voice, the pacing is off, the
interludes break the flow of the story, and the puns get annoying fast. This is
in stark contrast with Ted Chiang's works, which are great conceptually and
share some of the same fascinating themes (Tower of Babel, Hell is the absence
of God, the one about golems). The difference is that Chiang’s stories are well
crafted and come together as coherent wholes. They are emotionally driven,
memorable, well paced, and appropriate in length. </p>

<p>I got through half of the book over the last few months, in small chunks because
Eliana is so small, often having to put the book down out of annoyance. Today I
have decided to declare bankruptcy. I am not invested in the story, I don't care
about the characters, and I don't care what happens in the end. Perhaps one day,
if it is aggressively edited, I will give it another chance.</p>

    <title>Reason in Human Affairs by Herbert Simon</title>

      <div>
        <p>One of the people I worked with at CMU was a "Herbert A. Simon Professor of
Human-Computer Interaction". I hadn't heard of Herbert Simon before, but his
name came up again recently at the end of <a href="/books/skin-in-the-game-by-taleb-audio/">&quot;Skin in the Game&quot;</a>. Turns out Simon
was a pretty interesting guy, and had a lot to say about Rationality.</p>

<p>Simon was an academic, and mostly wrote for academic audiences. This is his
least academic book, and still presents a dry read. The first essay, called
"Visions of Rationality", describes three flavors of rationality: SEU,
Bounded Rationality, and Intuitive Rationality. I skipped the second essay
because it was too boring. The third essay was about rationality in
organizations, which is Simon's home turf, being a key figure in Organizational
Behavior.</p>

<p>Critically, Simon treats reason as "wholly instrumental. It cannot tell us where
to go; at best it can tell us how to get there. Thus, whereas reason may provide
powerful help in finding means to reach our ends, it has little to say about the
ends themselves".</p>

<p>Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) is the God-like “Olympian model”, but is not a
suitable model for the mind of man. That said, Rationalists tend to elevate this
model:</p>

<ol>
<li>Well defined utility function.</li>
<li>Well defined set of alternatives to choose from.</li>
<li>Can assign a consistent joint probability distribution to all future sets of
events.</li>
<li>Maximize the expected value of the utility function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bounded rationality postulates that our minds are limited, bounded by
computational powers. The model more closely reflects human ability:</p>

<ol>
<li>A mechanism to focus attention. "Rationality could focus on dealing with one
or a few problems at a time".</li>
<li>A mechanism capable of generating alternatives.</li>
<li>A capability for acquiring facts about the environment, the ability to draw
inferences from facts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Intuitive rationality recognizes that thought is often affected by emotion, 
which can usefully "distract you from your current focus of thought, and to call
your attention to something else that presumably needs attention right now.".
There is no contradiction between SEU/Bounded models and intuitive rationality.</p>

<p>I really liked Herb Simon’s take on novels over textbooks for teaching social
science. This “hot cognition” is what makes Ted Chiang’s stuff so compelling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most humans are able to attend to issues longer, to think harder about them,
  to receive deeper impressions that last longer, if information is presented in a
  context of emotion, a sort of hot dressing, than if it’s presented wholly
  without effect.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Darkness at Noon" vs. a history book or transcripts of Stalin's purges?</li>
<li>"War and Peace" vs. a treatise on military sociology?</li>
<li>Proust and Chekhov versus a textbook on personality?</li>
</ul>

<p>People respond well to story, but this leaves us with an important
responsibility: “if we are to learn our social science from novelists, then the
novelists have to get it right. The scientific content must be valid.” Example:
Freud’s stuff still permeates novels despite very few orthodox Freudians left in
psych today.</p>

    <title>The Fourth Turning by Howe and Strauss</title>

      <div>
        <p>I don’t remember why I decided to read this book. The political theory it
describes is loved by both Gore and Bannon. This surprisingly heterogeneous
recommendation reignited my interest when I saw it on my reading list. </p>

<p>The basic idea is this: history is cyclical with the unit of interest being
80-90 years. The authors call it a "saeculum", also known as a natural century,
or a long human life. Each saeculum has four stages with the last one climaxing
into a crisis. Each stage is associated with a general mood, and last roughly
20-22 years each. </p>

<ol>
<li>High - occurs after a crisis, institutions are strong, individuals weak. </li>
<li>Awakening - institutions are attacked in the name of personal autonomy. </li>
<li>Unraveling - institutions are weak, individuals strong. </li>
<li>Crisis - often involves destruction, sometimes war or revolution. </li>
</ol>

<p>Each stage brings forth a new generation with a distinct personality type which
evolves the generational lifespan.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prophets (eg. Boomers) enter childhood during a High, a time of rejuvenated
community life and consensus around a new societal order.</li>
<li>Nomads (eg. Gen X) enter childhood during an Awakening, a time of social
ideals and spiritual agendas, when young adults are passionately attacking
the established institutional order.</li>
<li>Heros (eg. Millenials, G. I. Generation) enter childhood during an
Unraveling, a time of individual pragmatism, self-reliance, and
laissez-faire.</li>
<li>Artists (eg. Gen Z, Silent Generation) enter childhood during a Crisis, a
time when great dangers cut down social and political complexity in favor of
public consensus, aggressive institutions, and an ethic of personal
sacrifice. </li>
</ol>

<p>The authors view <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory#Timing_of_generations_and_turnings">history through this lens</a>, for example citing
previous great crises in US history:</p>

<ul>
<li>1774-94: Era of the American Revolution and the Constitution</li>
<li>1860-68: the Civil War and its immediate aftermath </li>
<li>1929-45: and the Depression and the Second World War</li>
</ul>

<p>The book is written in 1997, and the authors make grand predictions for the next
decades, it's fun to see how well the theory predicts the present. It's still
too soon to know how accurate their predictions were, but it's already clear
that their track record will be a mixed bag.</p>

<p>The Crisis turning of this last saeculum was supposed to start sometime
2002-2008, peak around 2020, and resolve by 2026. Several important events can
be shoehorned into the theory as demarcating the beginning of the fourth
turning: 9/11 in 2001, the recession of 2008. Trump's election in 2016 can also
fit into their framework. Other things are way off. The way the media represents
millennials is quite far from heroic (at least so far). Or like the way that
millennial’s are supposed to be like GIs, community focused and socially
cohesive. The increased communitarianism in the 4th turning has not panned out. </p>

<p>A summary from Howe from 2017 retroactively glosses over the parts that don’t
fit, and focuses on those that do: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yfb2zQjKWE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yfb2zQjKWE</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the theory is unfalsifiable and overly general. Specific claims in the
book are often unsubstantiated. However I found it an entertaining read, and
potentially a fruitful “fake framework”. </p>

    <title>The Coffee-House: A Cultural History</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>A chronicle of coffee, especially focused on the coffee houses of 17th and 18th
century England. I found it too long-winded to recommend outright. So here's a
much shorter summary that captures the parts that I found most interesting.</p>

<p><strong>In Turkey</strong>, coffee was used by Sufis, "as a medicinal delicacy to enable the
pious and the studious to stay awake during their devotions". It was also used
more socially in many coffee houses throughout the Ottoman empire: "There sit
they chatting most of the day; and sippe of a drinke called Coffa (of the berry
that it is made of) in little China dishes, as hot as they can suffer it. It
came to symbolize freedom of assembly, so much so that "building a grand
coffee-house became one of the first things Ottoman rulers did in newly
conquered cities, to demonstrate the civility of their rule." Smyrma had over 40
coffee houses in 1658. In addition, it was very egalitarian in nature "because
all were served in turn, no man served another and, furthermore, each was seated
according to the order in which he arrived, rather than that of precedence
usually encountered in the hierarchical Ottoman state."</p>

<p><strong>Humble beginnings</strong>: It came to England from Turkey in the early 17th century,
after some initial struggle, since some thought that "while ‘coffa’ agrees very
well with the constitution of the Turk, [...] it will not suit that of the
Englishman".  The first coffee-man in London, Pasqua Rosee, was a lowly coachman
in the service of Daniel Edwards. His customers, having bought their coffee,
assembled in groups under his awning, and Rosee’s enterprise was apparently
successful.  He was criticized under xenophobic pretenses, and his establishment
was far removed from the elegant and comfortable structures the merchants
remembered from their days in the Levant. On my last trip to London, I saw a
blue plaque celebrating his 1652 ‘coffee-house’, locating their memorial on the
walls of the Jamaica Wine House.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee House</strong>: Daniel Edwards and Thomas Hodges, however, could see the
commercial potential of coffee and were unwilling to let pass the opportunity
Rosee’s shop presented.  Eventually, a proper coffee-house emerged, with
dedicated, specially furnished coffee room, with its fires and stoves for warmth
and preparing coffee, was a retail revolution, although such places quickly lost
their strangeness.  In the fanatical environment of the Interregnum and
Restoration, the coffee-house to many was a haven of civility, but also of
revolution, debate, philosophy, puzzles, socialization, equality, and upward
mobility.</p>

<p><strong>Criticism</strong>: But of course there were critics, many skeptical of coffee house
style debate, which was often seen as shallow, critiqued as falling into four
particular qualities of ruined discourse: gabbling, gossip, wheedling and
idleness. Is it just a waste of time? ‘at this place a man is cheated of what
is, by far more valuable than Mony, that is, Time’. On the other hand, "the
wakeful sobriety of coffee made the coffee-house the natural ally of this
puritan ideology of work and labour". Coffee houses in Turkey came under threat
when the kadis signed a protocol describing the properties of coffee and
declaring it unlawful for Muslims. It was later repealed. In England, "The King
was propelled to issue the proclamation [banning coffee houses] in 1675 in
response to the increasingly fractious nature of political debate". This attempt
ultimately failed, and "the defence of the coffee-houses, it was understood, was
a defence of freedom of speech." Later in England, it was rumored "that coffee
there was widely deployed as a contraceptive" in Persia.</p>

<p>Coffee houses played a part in many of today's important institutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>News: "on entering, customers were as likely to call out ‘What news?’ as they
were to order a dish of coffee."</li>
<li>Auctions: "were conducted ‘by an inch of candle’, in which a section of wax
candle was lit, and bidding continued until the flame went out, with the final
bid carrying the lot."</li>
<li>Stock brokers: "jobbers bought and sold securities on their own account. These
men made a ready market by facilitating buying and selling, because if someone
wanted to sell, jobbers ensured they could always find a buyer."</li>
<li>US central banking: "group of prominent financiers to discuss proposals for a
bank to provide credit for the fledgling republic, modelled on the Bank of
England."</li>
<li>American Revolution: "In America the coffee-house was also associated with
news and rebellion through the eighteenth century."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>End of an era</strong>: In the late 17th century, "Tea was much more expensive than
coffee and it remained a rarity long after coffee was ubiquitous in London". It
later surpassed coffee, but remained something that was "more often associated
with women, with consumption in the home and with luxury: and most often in a
combination of all three". At its peak, there were 500 coffee houses in London,
but eventually Coffee started to wane. "Many blamed tea, and the passing of the
coffee-house was certainly accompanied by an unprecedented rise in tea drinking
among the British people". As early as 1750 coffee consumption in Britain had
been eclipsed by that of tea. Tea was monopolized by the East India Company,
which was "able to use its political influence to manipulate the system of
tariff preferences to distort the trade." By the early nineteenth century almost
six times as much tea was drunk per capita as coffee.  In 1888 a City
businessman wrote that the golden age of coffee-houses, as depicted in the light
literature of the last century, has passed away for ever.</p>

<p><strong>European rivals</strong>: "Paradoxically, while coffee-houses waned in Britain,
various Contintental rivals – the French café, the Italian caffè and the
Viennese Kaffeehaus – prospered, both in reality and in the mind even of the
British." While Manet seems to celebrate café life, works like Interior ofa
Café, The Café Concert (1879) and Corner of the Café Concert (1878) also
suggests a powerful sense of anomie: in the sociable spaces of the city few
people seem to connect with each other. But there are exceptions, such as Café
Central, in the Herrengasse, had a central court with a high glass roof,
originally constructed to serve as an exchange for the merchants. Countless
journalists, lawyers, school-teachers, tradesmen and merchants, made the
Kaffeehaus not simply a place to socialise over coffee and read newspapers, but
also a central location for their intellectual life. Still the closest analogy
for Viennese Kaffeehaus in England was with the tavern or public house.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso revolution</strong>: by WW2, "coffee disappeared off the market for more
than a decade, to be replaced by foul-tasting, adulterated imitations and
substitutes".  After the war, Riservato started the Gaggia Experimental Coffee
Bar, known also as the Riservato, in the summer of 1953, modeled after Italian
Caffes.  Within a year a legion of exotic new espresso bars had opened across
London and the provinces: The Times noted ‘the mushroom growth of espresso
coffee bars in London’ in October 1955. In San Francisco’s North Beach an
Italian immigrant opened Café Trieste in 1957. The ‘espresso revolution’, as
Pearson called it on BBC radio in 1956, changed more than just the appearance of
coffee retailing, reintroducing some of the sociability once associated with the
coffee-house. But, "The ubiquity of coffee bars, and the sameness of their
design, also mitigated their revolutionary sociability for Laski, who suggested
that many of the coffee-bar habitués would be as happy in a traditional tea
shop." The coffee bar was not simply a home for working-class or middle-class
culture, but a space where young people of different social stations mixed
freely, confusing the hierarchies of value both of Marxist and conservative
analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Seattleization</strong>: In 1966 a Dutch immigrant, Alfred Peet, opened a whole-bean
coffee bar at the corner of Vine and Walnut in Berkeley. As the home of the Beat
poets and student protest, cafés and coffee-shops played an important part in
nurturing San Francisco’s cultural revolution in the 1960s. In 1970 three
college graduates who shared an enthusiasm for Peet’s coffee banded together to
open a coffee shop in Pike Place Market in Seattle, doing their own roasting. 
One of their number, Jerry Baldwin, came up with ‘Starbuck’, a name with no
special meaning to them other than a pleasing sound and look. By 2003, Starbucks
was more than twenty times larger than its nearest rival in the American market
Schultz (Starbucks CEO) refers repeatedly to ‘the romance of coffee’. These
deep-seated associations, he argues, can be evoked through aroma, but also
through reiteration.</p>

<p><strong>Got milk</strong>: At Starbucks, and other Seattleised coffee-bar
chains, ordering a coffee has become a farcically complex operation requiring
specific and artificial terms. ‘wet’ means without foam, ‘skinny’ means to use
skimmed milk, ‘with wings’ means the coffee is to take away. Although the
chain’s consumption of milk is vast, almost no mention of its origins,
suppliers, chemistry, preparation or flavour. But milk was rarely added to
coffee before the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-social</strong>: The sociability encouraged by Starbucks is based on
consumption, not conversation. The interior arrangements of the coffee shop
recalls the communal space of the early coffee-house, but atomises people into
distinct individuals, promising customers peace and security from others, not
encounter and discussion. A plaintive symbol of these ambitions is seen in the
encouragement coffee-house chains have given to wifi by which means individuals
using their own laptops can participate in the on-line ‘community’ of the
Internet, all the while remaining oblivious of the living world around them.
In the sanitised, lactified form of the branded chain, the coffee-house is no
longer oppositional, rebellious and dissident. This is their profit, but our
loss.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet these will o’er their Jewish Liquor <br />
  About Religion Jar and Bicker; <br />
  And rave till grown as Piping Hot, <br />
  As the dull Grout o’er which they sot. <br />

    <title>Skin in the Game by Taleb (audio)</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Taleb is back with another book. It has interesting, but poorly organized ideas.
Fortunately, it is mercifully short acting more of a summary of his previous
work (I only read Antifragile). I don't think I could handle much more virtiol.</p>

<p>First, the interesting parts.</p>

<p>The thesis of "Skin in the Game" is that decision makers need to be
subject to the downsides that arise from their bad decisions, not just the
upside of their good ones. Skin in the game used to be normal: some kings and
emperors would fight on the front lines. Lords traded personal risk for
prominence. In modernity, many decision makers, such as bureaucrats that make
decisions on whether or not to go to war, are shielded from their actions. He
makes some interesting arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big companies want employees to be family men. Because they have more
dependents and thus debt. So they are less likely to leave. </li>
<li>Cato’s injunction: it's better to have someone ask why you don’t have a statue
rather than why you do. </li>
<li>VR can never be compelling since there's no downside risk to you. You have no
skin in the game. (This might be a leap I'm taking).</li>
<li>The Silver Rule - negative version of the golden rule: don’t do to others what
you wouldn’t want them to do to you. He expands on the definition of "you",
which is interestingly applied in the plural as well, to individuals,
families, tribes, countries. This is the libertarian version of the Golden
Rule.</li>
<li>Static vs. dynamic inequality: an important distinction. Wealth inequality is
not itself bad. It would be fair if people rotated through the wealth classes
over their lifetimes. Taleb claims that they do (which I highly doubt) and
this is his critique of Picketty.</li>
<li>But the fact that the market permits the prince become the pauper is an
example of skin in the game. And actually this status loss is super
relatable to people (eg. Trump).</li>
<li>Taleb is in favor of parsimony, and suspicious of an argument defended by too
many data points. This is his critique of Pinker's "everything is awesome"
narrative.</li>
<li>Lindy effect - for some non-perishable things, the longer something exists the
longer it will continue to exist.</li>
<li>Peer reviews are problematic because your peers aren’t necessarily the right
judges. Instead, time is the only judge. (I agree in theory, but in
practice, time takes too long).</li>
<li>Religion can affect actions and words. To the extent that religions affect
words, Taleb is fine with it. He claims most modern religions affect words
only, and there is no function difference between a Catholic and an Atheist.</li>
<li>Claims that Atheists like Dawkins &amp; Harris don't properly understand the
distinctions between various kinds of belief. In practice, everyone has some
"religious" practices like honoring the dead.</li>
<li>Rationality of a belief makes no sense. The only rationality that makes sense,
is that of an action, any only from the standpoint of survival. That which
helps you survive is rational. From this perspective, whether or not you can
explain something has no bearing on whether it’s rational or not. </li>
<li>Good reminder: correlation between deaths matters. Even though Ebola kills
fewer people than bathtubs, it’s still a bigger risk because it's an
infectuous disease, and so has huge downside. </li>
<li>Loss aversion isn't an irrational bias. It's rational to be fearful of ruin.</li>
<li>Summary statistics are often misleading. “Never cross a river if it is on
average 4ft deep”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taleb concludes with thought provoking advice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never engage in virtue signaling;</li>
<li>Never engage in rent-seeking;</li>
<li>You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business.</li>
</ol>

<p>I take issue with the tone in which the book is written. Taleb's level of hatred
towards some ideas and people, especially Steven Pinker is quite funny and
jarring. Whole chapters, such as the one devoted to Intellectuals Yet Idiots,
come off as a giant rant. He makes a lot of ridiculous claims which deserve to
be ignored or made fun of:</p>

<ul>
<li>He insults people as "not even weightlifters". I think this is a reference to
his obsession with deadlifting.</li>
<li>Taleb uses “domestication" as an insult. But the flip side is that this is the
basis of a functional social system. </li>
<li>He claims that employees are just like slaves. But employment is at-will on
both sides, and the trend today is away from "lifer"-dom.</li>
<li>He disparages academics because "talk is cheap", yet writes many books with
pompous names.</li>
<li>He claims that public speakers get nervous because of the stage lights in
their eyes.</li>
<li>Made up words like econophaster, psychosophaster and scientism aren't
winning him any favors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taleb is a provocoteur. But why? His ideas are actually quite academic and
intellectual, so he's not trying to appeal to populist masses. So who <strong>is</strong>
his target audience? Who knows? Anyway, I listened to this book, and it was
probably more worthwhile than listening to podcasts, but that's a pretty low
bar. I can't really recommend you do the same, so here are some interesting
names that Taleb mentions instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>Herb Simon - bounded rationality: people are fundamentally limited. (I've been
meaning to read him since being a CMU student.)</li>
<li>Gerd Gigerenzer - many things appear illogical but are actually done for good
reasons. </li>
<li>Ken Binmore - the word “rational” is ill defined. It’s all about revealed
preferences. </li>
</ul>

    <title>The Modern Political Tradition: Hobbes to Habermas</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>An impressively comprehensive series of 36 half-hour <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/The-Modern-Political-Tradition-Hobbes-to-Habermas-Audiobook/B00K58X53Q">lectures on political
philosophy</a>. I wanted a political philosophy survey to better understand
some of the political articles I've been reading in Foreign Affairs, as well as
have a better sense of context for the current moment. </p>

<p>The lecturer, Lawrence Cahoone, is an engaging speaker, and organized the
material really well. He goes chronologically through some of modernity's most
influential political philosophers, and summarizes their most important ideas.
I found that Cahoone was able to summarize the philosophers I was familiar with
pretty succinctly, although of course it's very hard to avoid
oversimplification. I was also surprised by how many thinkers I hadn't even
heard of.</p>

<p>This was not an easy course to follow for a layperson like me. I found myself
having to re-listen to some of the more dense lectures multiple times before I
felt like I grasped the concepts. Some philosphers remain shrowded in mystery.
Most notably, Hegel and Strauss continue to defy summarization. In the latter
lectures, he does a great job of tying more modern and controversial ideas
surrounding feminism and multiculturalism back to older thinkers.</p>

<p>Here are some of the philosophers he covers, as well as brief summaries for me
to index on later. As a note to myself, here are ones that I thought were most
interesting, and would be worth delving into in more depth: Carl von Clausewitz,
Alexis de Tocqueville, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Leonard Hobhouse, Hannah
Arendt, Friedrich von Hayek, Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre, William
Galston, Michael Waltzer, Carol Gilligan, Charles Taylor, Aldo Leopold, Jürgen
Habermas, Benjamin Barber, Ernest Gelner. What follow are a survey of a survey,
brief notes on each philosopher that was mentioned in the course.</p>

<h2>Formation of Liberal Republicanism (Lectures 3 - 16)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plato - we need a philosopher king.</li>
<li>Machiavelli - Realpolitik. Politics is amoral. The enemy of my enemy is my
friend.</li>
<li>Hobbes - the state of nature is a war of all against all. In the social
contract, you give up rights for security. (Social contract)</li>
<li>Locke - people have natural rights to life, liberty and property. The
government isn’t your master, it’s your servant. (Liberty)</li>
<li>Rousseau - the noble savage was better off than the modern man because
everyone was equal. Independence, equality and community are most important.
"Man is born free yet is everywhere in chains". (Equality)</li>
<li>Kant - morals are derived from reason and not experience. And you must always
act according to the categorical imperative. Kant is a non-consequentialist,
outcome doesn’t matter. (Deontology)</li>
<li>Adam Smith - self-interest can be good. The invisible hand guides private self
interest to create public benefit. (Emergence, Markets)</li>
<li>Montesquieu - checks and balances will prevent despotism. Separate powers into
legislative, executive and judicial branches. (Checks and Balances)</li>
<li>Jefferson - inherited wealth and inherited debt is bad for society.</li>
<li>Hamilton - too much federation is bad, leads to internal conflict. Feared
“Petty republics without any shared unifying purposes”. Centralize for
strength: banks, patent office, etc.</li>
<li>Madison - tyranny of the majority is real. States/communities should have
equal power in some sense (eg. electoral college, 2 senators per state)</li>
<li>Richard Price - the French rightfully replaced King’s with laws. In favor of
elections and explicit consent. (Republicanism)</li>
<li>Edmund Burke - England depends on traditional institutions: royalty, the
church.  Political norms don't come from reason but from tradition.
(Conservatism)</li>
<li>Thomas Payne - there is no power above the people other than god. Natural
rights exist, according to reason. Burke is irrational, tradition is bad.</li>
<li>Joseph de Maistre (far right) - nature is inherently evil. Man must submit
soul to god and body to the state. The order is not rational.
(Counter-enlightenment)</li>
<li>William Godwin (far left) - government coercion is bad. Moral individuality and
rationally derived conduct is good. (Anarchy)</li>
<li>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (far far left) - there is no such thing as absolute
dominion. Property rights over indefinite timescale don’t make sense.
(Anarchy)</li>
<li>Leo Tolstoy - war and church are sources of violent coercion. Violence is
always evil even when monopolized by government. Logical continuation from
turning the other cheek from Christ. (Anarchic pacifism)</li>
<li>Johann Gottlieb Fichte - "For each people, a country, for each country, a
people". This means pan-German unification, mass literacy, etc. A sort of
celebration of diversity on a country level. (Nationalism)</li>
<li>Napoleon - The draft changed warfare forever. No more chivalrous knights,
fealty for the king and hired mercenaries. Just a 600k strong standing army.
(Conscription)</li>
<li><strong>Carl von Clausewitz</strong> - "War is the continuation of politics by other means".
"Real war" is ritualized, chivalrous, traditional. But "ideal war" is pure
conflict, fewer rules, objective is to make your opponents surrender. (War
theory)</li>
<li>Isaiah Berlin - negative liberty (freedom from x, liberty from coercion) vs
positive liberty (freedom to do y, self determination). Positive liberty means
there are multiple “goods”, requiring a pluralistic society.</li>
<li>Hegel - Everything has a thesis, a counter thesis, and then a synthesis
combining both. (Dialectic?)</li>
<li><strong>Alexis de Tocqueville</strong> - Traditional society gave aristocratic individuals
freedom, provided structures of mutual obligation. Modern citizens are
independent free and equal but alone so the government will have to do many
things that family, guilds, feudal structures did before. But in America this
can be mitigated with clubs, churches, other “civil society” outside of
politics. (Civil society)</li>
<li>Jeremy Bentham and James Mill - natural rights is “nonsense on stilts”, the
guiding star is general utility. And this means what people actually value
(from experience, not kantian intuition). Bentham: “push-pin (a children's
game) is as good as poetry” (Utilitarianism)</li>
<li>John Stuart Mill - there is a hierarchy of pleasures. “It is better to be a human
dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a
fool satisfied.” Act to maximize total pleasure overall. Also the harm
principle: be free up to the point of harming others. Harm here
is specifically utilitarian (eg. affecting others concretely, ie. not eating
pork in private). Diversity of opinion is important, marketplace of ideas
brings us closer to the truth. (Liberalism)</li>
<li>Henry J. S. Maine - the individual surpasses the family as the unit to which
law applies. (Individualism)</li>
<li>Eric Weil - loss of community is part of modernity in favor of a looser
association and voluntary groups.</li>
<li><strong>Émile Durkheim</strong> - Modern society is characterized by specialization.
Traditional society was fractal - every hunter gatherer group was the same,
now they vary. (Specialization)</li>
<li>Georg Simmel - Money dehumanizes.</li>
<li><strong>Max Weber</strong> - work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity
is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends.
Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to
a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an
all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)</li>
<li>Friedrich Nietzsche - "God is dead" and modern society is sick. What are the
values that increase the viability of a society? Definitely not equality,
since without ambition it turns mankind into a herd. Need Übermensch to
transcend the Judeo-Christian tradition by finding meaning in chaotic
modernity.</li>
<li>Sigmund Freud - people are still basically primitive and have drives that
contradict modern values. This leads to inevitable regressions like world war
1 and 2.  (Drive theory)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Crisis of Liberal Republicanism from 1914 to 1953 (Lectures 17 - 20)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Leonard Hobhouse</strong> - Laissez faire capitalism didn’t work and reduced the
world to “Manchesterism” - terrible industrial dystopia. Sought a softer mix
of liberalism and socialism. “Organic liberalism” is consequentialist, and
should improve society. People are inherently social, and any impact they have
must be reflected there. Communitarian, interactionist, prescient.</li>
<li>William J. Brian - empower the poor against the elites. Hallmark of populism
is railing against the economic hegemony and social
conservatism. (Populism)</li>
<li>Roosevelt - large monopolies have too much power. The wealthy few form a
tyranny of the minority. 3 C’s: consumer protection, control of corporations,
conservation of natural resources. A shift to more presidential/executive
power to reform the constitution and modernize it.</li>
<li>Wilson - again shift to more presidential power. Checks and balances are too
constraining. Political society is evolving.</li>
<li>Eduard Bernstein - capitalism will evolve to be more socialist organically,
and markets don’t need to be fully abolished. What’s important is that workers
are treated better. (Soft socialism)</li>
<li>Lenin - communism won’t come on its own. Bernstein is a political prostitute.
Communism needs a revolution and a hard line proletarian government that is
wholly dedicated to ushering the new era. Freedom isn’t possible until then so
all spheres of life, including art, must serve this goal. (Totalitarian
socialism)</li>
<li>György Lukács / Theodor Adorno / Max Horkheimer - capitalism lacks any
reference point from which to criticize it. It commodifies everything too
well. But despite western leanings they were quite sympathetic to Leninism.
“parliamentary democracy is like having a debate club at the edge of the
abyss.” The enlightenment wears away at beliefs, so all that remains is power.</li>
<li>Georges Sorel - True morality requires martial virtue, readiness for violence,
and self sacrifice. (Anarcho syndicalism)</li>
<li>Carl Schmitt - Fascism is an enlightened rationalist dictatorship. Politics is
above economics, morality, etc. Social contract theory is wrong. Even Locke
wanted there to be an emergency valve where the executive branch takes over.
But then the executive must also decide if there’s an emergency in the first
place. Ultimately it comes down to a non-rational decision. It’s a theological
politics. (Fascism)</li>
<li>Peter Drucker - Fascism is disappointed socialism. Need something less
international, less economic centric. Especially in light of standing armies
of WW1, nationalism is key, and there needs to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Mg6Gfh9Co">bigger
idea</a>. (Nationalism)</li>
<li><p><strong>Hannah Arendt</strong> - totalitarianism of Hitler and Stalin is unlike anything
that came before. Total organization of society is mobilized for the state.
Nothing remains of civil society. No more art or chess for its own sake. She
characterized Nazis as banality of evil, just following orders while comma
unthinkable atrocities. (Totalitarianism) Distinction between labor, work, and
action:</p>

<ul>
<li>Labor is recurring and pure maintenance: cooking, dishes, chores,
ephemeral output.</li>
<li>Work results in durable output: fixing the car, wiring poetry.</li>
<li>Action: deeds and speeches of free and equal individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>For Arendt, action &gt; work &gt; labor, but modernity focuses too much on economics
and so devalues work in favor of labor and action in favor of work. Powerful
argument against both capitalism and marxism framed in art. For capitalists,
the value of art is financial, for marxists, it's instrumental: for the sake
of advancing communism. For her, it's intrinsic.</p></li>
<li>Giulio Douhet - since so much depends on military technology, produced in
factories, factories and civilians are legitimate targets.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Political theory during the Cold War (Lectures 21 - 24)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Michael Oakeshott - political behavior cannot be deduced from rationalism alone.
Politics can be engineered and must be guided by practical knowledge. Great
analogy to recipes: you need cooking skills to make a great dish, not just
rule following.</li>
<li>Ludwig von Mises - a planned economy is actually impossible. It’s too complex.
Markets have emergent properties and no central planner can know it.
(Anti-communist)</li>
<li><strong>Friedrich von Hayek</strong> - Government should ensure equal rights but not equal
outcomes. Avowed anti-rationalist, believes in limitations of rationality, and
so spontaneous order created by multiple individuals. Markets are both good
and bad, you must have losers to have winners. The market must remain free,
but the losers can be propped up by the government. The market isn’t a
meritocracy, but based around value, or willingness to pay. Hayek is in
favor of free market regulation, for some domains: safety, sanitation,
breaking up monopolies, even health care. The worst is when prices, wages, and
production schedules are fixed by the government because it breaks emergent
spontaneity.</li>
<li>Milton Friedman - in favor of negative income tax or basic income. Opposed to
professional licensing run by governments. (Libertarianism)</li>
<li>Leo Strauss - Philosophy is fundamentally always inconclusive. Athens vs
Jerusalem: religion has all of the answers, but the ancient philosophers could
deal with the uncertainty of taking philosophy seriously.</li>
<li>Alexandre Kojève - history ended with Napoleon and Hegel. No more
qualitative changes in human thinking.</li>
<li>Herbert Marcuse - Advanced capitalism is totalitarian, integrating everything
into itself. Example: music that may have begun as counter culture like jazz,
hip hop, rock eventually gets played at the Super Bowl. In post capitalism,
work becomes play. “One dimensional man” was the Bible for the new left and
SDS of the 60s (New Left)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Domestic political arguments (Lectures 25 - 28)</h2>

<ul>
<li>John Rawls - what distribution of material wealth is just? Socialists usually
focus on outcomes, neoliberals on history. Rawls is a progressive deontologist.
Veil of Ignorance forces people to make ideal laws for a society without
knowing what their position will be. In this case, take the maximin approach:
best worst case. The only acceptable inequality is due to talent &amp; hard work,
not birth status. “Fair opportunity“. Difference principle: remove inequality
until it hurts the least advantages. Contrast to Pareto efficiency principle,
which doesn't care about individuals, but just overall outcome. (Fair
opportunity)</li>
<li>Ayn Rand - hates altruism from a Nietzsche perspectives. Selfishness is good
because people have value in themselves. So capitalism is the only moral
system of government. Society is only great in so far as it’s individuals are
great. In favor of minimal states: optional taxes for police and military.
(Objectivism)</li>
<li>Robert Nozick - Any distribution scheme is unjust because it requires too much
intervention to maintain. Inevitably people will gain a promotion or lose a
job, disrupting the distribution. Also you don’t owe anyone for your fortune
in life: analogy of musician who plays outside your house and then comes with
a bill the next day - you don’t owe them. The veil of ignorance is contrived.
It works for “life boat” cases and other emergency cases, but not in society
where how you got your money matters. Imagine living your life based on how
others want you to live, and you sell shares in your decisions. This is the
opposite of free society, some degree of slavery. (Libertarianism)</li>
<li><strong>Michael Sandel</strong> - Rawls and Nosick are wrong because some values are unchosen:
community, family, etc. the rest are chosen on top. In some cases, individual
liberty can impact community from which that individual liberty is partly
derived. Therefore some things should not become commodities to be bought and
sold: a mother child relationship, surrogacy, outsourcing child rearing etc is
wrong. (Communitarianism)</li>
<li><strong>Alasdair MacIntyre</strong> - Meaning can only be found in narrative, which is
based on the culture and community you belong to. He rejects modernism and
prefers premodern Aristotle to postmodern Nietzsche.</li>
<li><strong>William Galston</strong> - positive liberalism is important but is one of many
worthy values. He rejects moral monism (foxes &gt; hedgehogs) and thinks these
values are in general conflict. Ultimate values are: life itself,
purposiveness, instrumental rationality.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Waltzer</strong> - distributive justice is important but not why Rawls
thinks. A just distribution of a good depends on the good and cultural
conditions. Food, swimming pools, education are all different so distribution
should vary.  What is bad about income inequality? Tyranny of one type
of good over another: it’s that money can buy everything: security,
healthcare, better cars, sex, political influence, commutation (avoiding the
draft). It’s bad when different “spheres of justice” become too asymmetrical.
Free market rules only apply to the bazaar, but treating everything as commerce
ruins things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feminism, Multiculturalism, Environmentalism, Postmodernism (Lectures 29 - 32)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Susan Okin - progressive justice doesn’t take into account women’s special
rights. Women in reality make less, so no fault marriage is equal but unjust.
Wife beating is political in the same way that racially motivated crime is.
The private is political. Women are generally more focused on the private.
(Feminism)</li>
<li><strong>Carol Gilligan</strong> - normal development for humans is masculinized by society.
In fact women are fundamentally different (essentialist). Men think in terms
of rights and rules. Women focus more on care, community.</li>
<li>Iris Marion Young - identity is often construed as negative. Example: Who am
I? I’m not like this cis-gendered white male! Critical of negative identity
because individuals belong to many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Charles Taylor</strong> - all cultures deserve to be recognized but what is their
respective value? Should Shakespeare and Achebe get the same amount of
coverage in school? Cultures are of equal value is nonsensical, muzzles
critical powers.</li>
<li>Bhikhu Parekh - the majority culture should adjust to its immigrants. For
example, wearing a turban is a disadvantage for motorcycling, hence the Sikh
helmet exception law in the UK, which is just to normalize the disadvantage.</li>
<li>Brian Barry - individuals should not be disadvantaged by the groups they are
born into. The Amish must stop preventing their children from going to high
school. (Assimilation)</li>
<li>Will Kymlicka - in liberalism, a group has as much rights as the sum total of
rights of its individuals. But this doesn’t work for small groups like
indigenous tribes. This gets tricky if liberties undermine the culture of the
minority community. (Multiculturalism)</li>
<li>John Muir - preserve nature as it is because it is sacred. (Preservation)</li>
<li>Gifford Pinchot - conserve nature but still allow it to be used for human
purposes. (Managed Conservation)</li>
<li>Peter Singer - argues for animal welfare on a utilitarian basis. Their
suffering should be reduced wherever possible. Applies to mammals and probably
birds and amphibians. Speciesism is the analogue of sexism, racism etc.
(Animal rights)</li>
<li>Tom Regan - non human animals have deontological rights. They have an identity
and so have inherent value and rights. (Kantian animal rights)</li>
<li><strong>Aldo Leopold</strong> - animals eat one another in the wild, but we now have
control over ecosystems. We must "think like a mountain". This is a
communitarian approach often driven by the desire to keep biodiversity high.
(Moral ecology)</li>
<li>Richard Rorty - there is no non circular justification for any philosophical
argument. (Anti-foundationalism)</li>
<li>Jean-François Lyotard -  everything is mediated by culture, which</li>
<li>manifests as a series of signs. Beyond that, it’s all language games. (Radical
structuralism)</li>
<li>Michel Foucault - truth is defined by society and is intended for controlling
the people. Society has constructed its canon out of straight white men. This
is a problem, and blacks, women, and homosexuals need to be brought into the
fray. Biases inherent in western ideals, feminist, multicultural ideas are
all legacies. (Postmodernism)</li>
<li><p><strong>Jürgen Habermas</strong> - attempts to defend enlightenment and modernism from both
Nietzsche postmodernism and conservative premodernism. Expands notion of
rationality to communication. Kinds of rationality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Epistemically rationality: what is true.</li>
<li>Instrumental rationality: rational action.</li>
<li>Communicative rationality (Habermas): we can decide together what we should
do. If what parties are saying is expressed dishonestly, it’s strategic
communication.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>Democracy is all about communicative rationality. There is a conflict between
“the system” and the “lifeworld”, first of which is money and power driven,
second is democratic communicative action. System infringes on the life world:
less is decided conversationally and more moneyed.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Post cold war (Lectures 33 - 35)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Francis Fukuyama - History is about the slaves seeking and achieving equality
(Hegel, Kojev). We're well on our way now, and nothing will really beat
liberal democracy ever. Problem is that the end-state (universal equality) is
bad because it leads to Nietzches “last man”, an ambitionless passiveness. So
there must be room for individual thriving, or Thumos. (End of History)</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin Barber</strong> - We accidentally flooded the world with mcworld, the 3
Ms: McDonald’s, Macintosh, MTV, but not with the civil society requires for
democracy. “Neither Jihad nor McWorld promises a remotely democratic future”.
Model: Tocqueville. (Jihad vs. McWorld)</li>
<li>Samuel Huntington - Culture matters to how states govern.  Listen 9 modern
civilizations: Eastern Europe, greater China, Islamic belt, India, Japan, etc.
Conflicts will occur at the borders between these civilizations.  Western
culture is not replicable. Elements are exportable, but it won’t be a full
package. Globalism will increase tension and resistance because identity is
often constructed negatively. (The Clash of Civilizations)</li>
<li><strong>Ernest Gelner</strong> - airlifting free elections and market economy into Soviet
block countries isn’t sufficient. What you need is modern civil society, by
which he means a plurality of ideas: neither church, nor market, nor govt can
dominate. Life is modular and each part follows different rules. So pluralism
is key. In the West this loss of identity was OK because of nationalism. Most
countries are no longer Ideocracies (single moral idea, no pluralism) with the
exception of those dominated by political Islam. </li>
<li>Mahatma Gandhi/Martin Luther King - forceful non violent resistance but
inspired by Tolstoy. (Non-violent resistance)</li>
<li>William T. Sherman - open to war as needed. "War is hell". (War Realism)</li>
<li><strong>Michael Waltzer</strong> (this time on war) - War is sometimes justified but is
regimented by rules for going to war and then conduct during war. (Contrast to
Just War Pacifism, which thinks modern technology is too dangerous to ever
use.) Codified in Geneva and Hague conventions.  But tricky for civil wars:
are the rebels criminals (to be punished) or combatants (protected by Geneva)?
Terror against civilians is never ok, and tricky for combatants. Peacekeeping
is justified if the target country is no longer able to guarantee rights to
its people ("the right to have rights"). For example if there’s a genocide the
country is unable to protect its citizens or is complicit in the act and must
be stopped. Less clear who needs to intervene though. Dirty hands: politicians
cannot be deontologists but must consider the utilitarian outcome for their
people. (Just War theory)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great overview of some philosophical underpinning of politics. I
learned a ton, gleaming new things about philosophers I was already familiar
with because of superior summarization, and learning about completely new
philosophers I hadn't even heard of before. Well worth a listen, and a
re-listen.</p>

    <title>Scale by Geoffrey West</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/scale-by-geoffrey-west"/>
    
    <updated>2018-02-23T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/scale-by-geoffrey-west</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I listened to a podcast with Geoffrey West and thought his ideas were compelling
enough that I should delve deeper. "Scale" covers a lot of ground, but the main
focus is what West calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allometry">allometric</a> (as opposed to isometric)
scaling laws, which means a nonlinear relationship. </p>

<p>True to his physicist roots, West looks for a unified theory of everything. 
According to him, biologists in general lack an appreciation for theory. And in
general biology has us “drowning in a sea of data and thirsting for some
theoretical framework with which to understand it”. The same can be said about
the other, even less scientific fields that are subject to West's analysis:
cities, economies, and companies.</p>

<p>West invokes colorful characters like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a> (what a
name!) and his ship building adventures. His insight was that scaling law favor
long ships: the main slowing factor in drag is cross sectional area, but thing
to optimize is volume. </p>

<p>One of the earliest formulations of allometric scaling is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law">Klieber's
law</a>. Animal metabolic rates scale as the ¾ power of the animal's
mass. Many other traits follow similar power laws with exponents that are
integral multiples of ¼. This pattern holds in many other examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biomass produced by insects ~ Mass of colony ^ 3/4</li>
<li>Heart rates of animals ~ Mass of animal ^ -1/4</li>
<li>White matter volume ~ Gray matter volume ^ 5/4</li>
<li>Metabolic rate for cells ~ Mass of cell ^ 3/4</li>
</ul>

<p>West poses the question: why ¼ is such an important and recurring ratio? He
turns to network theory and fundamentals for an explaination: "these networks
are constrained by three postulates: they are space filling, have invariant
terminal units, and minimize the energy needed to pump fluid through the
system." </p>

<p>The physics of blood flow was first understood by <a href="https://blogs.royalsociety.org/publishing/thomas-youngs-surprising-contribution-to-biomechanics/">Thomas Young</a>, the
same guy (polymath) most famous for his double slit experiment. Interesting is
that blood pressure is invariant across all animals regardless of size. One of
the characteristics is that in animal pipes (veins and arteries), and plants
(fiber bundles), the sum of cross sectional area of inflow has to equal sum of
cross sectional area of outflow.</p>

<p>West tries really hard to make the book accessible to a wide range of readers,
and is careful to never use any equations in the book. One unfortunate side
effect of this is that he isn't able to complete the argument and actually
derive the reason why multiples of ¼ show up so often. I had to look up <a href="http://mathbench.umd.edu/modules/misc_scaling/page22.htm">the
math</a> later.</p>

<p><em>Something I haven't thought about is how blood flow goes from pulsative (near
heart) to non pulsative (at capillaries). How does this transition occur? I'd
love to do an explorable explanation around this. Small mammals can’t exist
because pulsative transmission is more efficient and requires a minimum vessel
size. Is this related to why AC is more effective at travelling long distances
than DC?</em></p>

<p>Next, he turns to fractals. Measuring lengths of borders between countries, the
higher the resolution the longer the length. In non-fractal situations, higher
resolution causes convergence to a value. In fractal situations, higher
resolution causes the value to increase indefinitely.  You can quantify how
fractal something is by looking at how quickly it’s length decreases as a
function of resolution. So it’s basically:</p>

<pre><code>fractality = - d(length) / d(resolution)
</code></pre>

<p>This was first identified when trying to measure lengths of coastlines, leading
to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox">Coastline paradox</a>, first identified by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson">Richardson</a>. A straight line has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension">fractal dimension</a> 1, but
crinkly and fjord-filled borders of Norway have fractality 0.5 by the above
definition, and so has a fractal dimension of 1 + 0.5 = 1.5. The crinkliest line
would have a dimension close to 2, which corresponds to the fractal dimension of
a perfectly smooth surface. The crinkliest surface would have a dimension close
to 3, corresponding to a volume. This is fascinating since now we’re talking
about a continuum in R^n, where n is no longer an integer! </p>

<p><em>I wonder... What would fractal dimension greater than 3 look like?</em></p>

<p>Even time series can be fractal: you can’t tell the time scale by looking at a
snapshot of the value of a stock over time. I wondered if there were clear
fractals in nature, as observed in satellite imagery, and <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/googleearth/">found this
site</a>. Also, it would be very neat to have an AxiDraw generate
fractal drawings. I went on a tangent, the way to do this would be with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Smooth shapes are very rare in the wild but extremely important in the ivory
  tower and factory.” - Mandelbrodt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason growth stops is that there are too many cells to support at some
point, so no more extra energy to spend on creating net new ones. Holds true for
individuals, colonies of organisms, and tumors. In terms of aging and human
limits, the average age has been going up but the max seems to be converging at
125. Most age related damage happens at the terminals (capillaries, mitochondria).
These are space filling so evenly distributed throughout.  The larger the
animal, the slower the metabolic rate and so less damage at terminals and so
longer lifespan. </p>

<p>Caloric restriction and temperature reduction are both viable ways of increasing
lifespans but obviously have negative side effects. Also these methods yield
only moderate improvement, an order of 10%.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Even if every cause of death were eliminated, all humans are destined to die
  before they reach 125.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cities also have scaling patterns associated with them. There’s an economy of
scale of many infrastructure elements: gas station, length of roads, electrical,
water and gas lines, all scale at <code>rate ~ population ^ 0.85</code>. At the same
time, socioeconomic metrics scale at a super linear rate. Number of patents,
wages, crime rates, number of restaurants, scale at <code>rate ~ population ^ 1.15</code>. </p>

<p>There are inherent limits to how many people you can know: 5 intimates, 15 close
friends, 50 acquaintances, 150 familiars. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a>,
which seems to be fundamental and spans across societies. Another pattern is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's Law</a> which originated for words usage which varies inversely with rank.
Example: “the” is most frequently used at 7%, next is “of” at 3.5% (1/2), then
“and” at 2.3% (1/3). Same non-normal distribution applies to size of cities and
companies. </p>

<p>Socioeconomic interactions in a city are the sum of interactions between people.
If everyone knew everyone it would be a power law with exponent 2. But because
of these limits like Dunbar’s number and Zipf's Law, there’s still a super
linear relationship but the exponent is closer to 1 than 2. But why does
infrastructure sublinearly and socioeconomic scale superlinearly? In
infrastructure the biggest flow are main arteries: highways, major sewers,
aortas. The nodes have capillary like access with small flows. In
socioeconomics, the biggest flow is between terminals, or people. The rest just
facilitated people getting together so have a smaller relative flow of
information.</p>

<p>Movement in cities in general is not random but very structured: most commonly,
going from home to work and back, or home to another place and back. And there
are clear patterns, such as this inverse square one: number of people visiting a
location at a distance (r) and a number of times per month (f) is given by a
power law: <code>n ~ (r f) ^ -2</code>.</p>

<p>West presents an interesting critique of per-capita metrics in cities: “it
implicitly assumes that the baseline for any urban characteristic is that it
scales linearly with population” contrary to the thesis of this book. Instead,
per capita metrics should be compared to the expected values of those metrics
based on the size of the city and the scaling law. He proposes a scale called
Scale Adjusted Metro Indicators (SAMIs). Apparently San Francisco has a really
good SAMI for innovation. I wonder how Seattle stacks up?</p>

<p>Organisms vs. cities vs. companies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Organisms: sublinear scaling and economies of scale dominating biology lead to
stable bounded growth and slowing pace of life. </li>
<li>Cities: superlinear scaling dominating socioeconomic activity leads to
unbounded growth and increasing pace of life. </li>
<li>Companies scale more like organisms than like cities. There is an analogy
between metabolism and revenue, between maintenance and expenses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like organisms that have a maximum size, companies also stop growing in
relation to the market. There’s a temporal aspect too, by 20 years, 85% of
companies disappear through bankruptcy or liquidation. </p>

<p>Speculation on why companies die: R&amp;D fraction goes down over time. More rules
and process over time, ossification of processes. More focused on short term
results and a “tried and true” strategy. (Google appears to be good at
mitigating a lot of this, may be in some sense more city-like).</p>

<p>I don’t understand why superexponential means that there must be finite time
singularities. It seems to me like <code>e^x &lt; f(x) &lt; \inf</code> between the two. West's
overall view is that major paradigm shifts happen increasingly frequently.
Either we will need to be more and more innovative or learn to “be content with
what we’ve got and find some new way of defining progress”. </p>

<p>A surprisingly zenful end to a whirlwind of a book. It opened up my eyes to a
lot of interesting ideas. I recommend it!</p>

    <title>Anthem by Ayn Rand</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/anthem-by-ayn-rand"/>
    
    <updated>2018-01-28T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/anthem-by-ayn-rand</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I’ve made multiple attempts at reading both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but can get no further than the first 50 or so pages. Luckily, this novella only has 50 or so pages in it, so this is an Ayn Rand book I can finish!</p>

<p>Anthem is a post-apocalyptic dystopia that operates as a communist state. There is a planned economy, jobs are allocated by the government. Everything sucks, you have no freedoms. Pronouns are different: saying "I" is punishable by death, and so the first person is always "we", and the third always "they", which sounds surprisingly modern (not an endorsement). Romantic attraction is illegal, and sex is only done on a special day, with a partner provided by the Eugenics administration. Everything is done for the collective, everybody must be happy. Oh and by the way, this society somehow forgot technology, and is now living in the technological dark ages. In practice, everything is terrible, and everyone lives in fear.</p>

<p>The lack of nuance or any sort of silver lining in this novel is truly astounding. Ayn Rand’s ideas of what is good can be inferred directly from negating everything about the dystopian society.</p>

<p>The fact that the protagonist immediately sees all of the implications of the primitive electrical circuit that he discovers in his makeshift laboratory is clearly Rand projecting her love for progress. A lot of the rest of the writing lacks any sort of subtlety. The contrast between the bureaucratic Council of Scholars and the entrepreneurial rebel protagonist, supported by their piety towards antiquated technology is really on the nose.</p>

<p>Still, it has its moments, such as this passage reeling against group think and "design by committee":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"What is not thought by all men cannot be true," said Collective 0-0009. "Should it be what they claim of it," said Harmony 9-2642, "the it would bring ruin to the Department of Candles. The Candle is a great boon to mankind, as approved by all men. Therefore, it cannot be destroyed by the whim of one."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ayn Rand seems to really enjoy asking rhetorical questions. I remember reading up to the "Who is John Galt?" Of one of her other novels. This one features chapters ending with questions like "What— even if we have to burn for it like the Saint of the Pyre— what is the Unspeakable word", and later, when the protagonist begins to awaken from his socialist stupor, "And we felt torn, torn for some word we could not find." Until finally the protagonist has their epiphany, which is of course that there exists a first-person singular pronoun, and the unbridled individualism that comes with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the word "We" must never be spoken, save by one’s choice and as a second thought. This word must never be placed first within man’s soul, else it becomes a monster, the root of all the evils on earth, the root of man’s torture by men, and of an unspeakable lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m glad Ayn Rand has the answers. Certainly, she has the zealotry of a fanatic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride. This god, this one word: I.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering why this society collapsed in the first place? Obviously because of the collective!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What disaster took their reason away from men? ... The worship of the word
  "we". When men accepted that worship, the structure of centuries collapsed
  about them, the structure whose every beam had come from the thought of some
  one man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ayn Rand’s writing is intense and views are extreme. At the very least, the book is historically interesting, and provides a counterpoint to the left leaning views espoused by my friends. Unfortunately this short novella is written in a way too closely resembling a wrecking ball persistently swinging at an already crumbling building.</p>

    <title>Impro by Keith Johnstone</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/impro-by-keith-johnstone"/>
    
    <updated>2018-01-24T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/impro-by-keith-johnstone</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I picked this book up because of a recommendation from the Internet. My first reaction was negative: the author’s claim pointing at things and calling them wrong names will cause your whole sense of perception to shift: colors become more vivid, outlines become sharper, people look smaller, the shape of the room changes. This, presented not as metaphorical truth, or a parable, but as actual truth, is something I continue to find hard to swallow. That said I think the essays in the book are worth it, if you suspend a bit of disbelief.</p>

<p>Next, I was disappointed in the long-winded story-of-my-life narrative that the book begins with. I recommend skipping the "Notes on Myself" section, as I did. What follows are three mind-opening essays called Status, Spontenaity, and Narrative Skills. These essays touch on a variety of subjects nominally about improvisation and the theatre, but are written in a way that feels applicable beyond the stage. The last essay on Masks and Trance I found to be somewhat more esoteric, and harder to imagine applying to reality. Here are some interesting tidbits from the book:</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Before improvising a scene, a helpful technique is to decide your place in the status hierarchy in relation to the other actors. What Johnstone means by status isn’t necessarily some socio-economic standing in the world, but more of an internal confidence which corresponds to a pecking order. In the animal sense, low status means "don’t bite me, I’m not tasty", while high status means "don’t come near, I bite". Status can also be a lens with which to analyze any social interaction, and Johnstone presents dialogue that he annotates with status transactions, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sgnarelle: [Raising himself] I’m the master.
  Martine: [Lowers S, raises self] And I’m telling you that I’lol have you do as I want. I didn’t marry you to put up with your nonsense.
  S: [Lowers Martine] Oh! The misery of married life! How right Aristotle was when he said wives were the very devil.
  M: [Lowers S and Aristotle]: Just listen to the clever fellow — him and his blockhead of an Aristotle!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, status manifests in various physical ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eye contact: breaking it can cause status loss. Not making it in the first place can cause status gain.</li>
<li>Controlling space: low status players shut off their own space (eg. servants kneeling, bowing, prostrating). High status allows their space to flow into other people (eg. drill sergeant yelling at someone from an inch away) </li>
<li>Leg position: toes inward for low status, outward for high.</li>
<li>Stillness: holding still while speaking raises status. Fidgeting lowers it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Status is also a useful tool for examining jokes and narratives in general. For example, when high status individuals lower in status, the rest rise up in status, and vice versa. Explains why kings had low status courtiers (eg. midgets, jesters) in their midst.</p>

<p>Interesting games:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding swearwords gratuitously. Loosens the atmosphere, for example:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buy something, I shout
  I want a hat, buckteeth!
  Buckteeth! Try this on for size, you jerk.
  You call <em>me</em> a jerk? Cowflop!</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Master-servant, where both players act as if all of the space belongs to the master. A variant where the master can snap at the servant if he is displeased, and the servant dies after 3 snaps. The master doesn’t need to be reasonable. </li>
<li>Another variant with more people in a proscribed pecking order.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t myself see that an educated man in this culture necessarily has to understand the second law of thermodynamics, but he certainly should understand that we are pecking-order animals and that this affects the tiniest details of our behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Spontenaeity</h2>

<p>Johnstone begins with a tirade against school. "Most schools encourage children to be unimaginative. The research so far shows that imaginative children are disliked by their teachers." And I anecdotally agree, from my own experience, as well as Seymour Papert’s writings. He argues that schooling beats creativity out of children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose an eight year old writes a story about being chased down a mouse hole by a monstrous spider. No one will worry. But if he writes the same story when he’s fourteen, it may be taken as a sign of mental abnormality. Writing such things leaves the adolescent up to criticism. He therefore has to fake everything so that he appears ‘sensitive’ or ‘witty’ or ‘intelligent’ according to the image he is trying to establish in the eyes of other people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This essay’s goal is to try to fix the above, providing an antidote to the switch-off that occurs at puberty. For example, when responding to "what’s for supper?", there is a temptation to think of something really clever. You will be too slow, and come up with something lame like "fried mermaid", but if you said "fish" quickly, would be better. </p>

<p>Some exercises:</p>

<ul>
<li>Story invention by completing the next phrase, eg: "Imagine a man walking along the street. Suddenly he hears a sound and turns to see something moving in the doorway..." By this point the other person has come up with a mental image. "What is he wearing?" "A suit" "What type of suit?" "Striped", etc. It’s like visualization that happens when you read a book.</li>
<li>This can be done implicitly, for example if you are asked to act an emotion "be sad", it can help to improvise by inventing a story about why.</li>
<li>Association games: "tell me a color", "put your hand in an imaginary box, what do you take out?" "A cricket ball" "unscrew it, what’s inside?" "A medallion" "What’s written on it?" "Christmas 1948"</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who say "Yes" are rewarded by the adventures they have, and those that say "No" are rewarded by the safety they attain.</p>
  
  <p>At all points we would say "No" in life, we want to see the actors yield and say "Yes".</p>
  
  <p>If you’ll stop reading for a moment and think of something you wouldn’t want to happen to you, or to someone you love, then you’ll have thought of something worth staging or filming.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Accept all: in an improv act, say "yes and" to everything. Never block any offers.</li>
<li>Learn to make interesting offers, "Good morning!" is dull. But "Good morning, great heavens Frank, did they let you out?" is interesting.</li>
<li>Two places: one actor pretends to be, for example, waiting at a bus stop while the other claims stage is living room.</li>
<li>Presents: pretend to give presents to another actor, and they have to be very delighted with them and come up with what the present was.</li>
<li>It’s Tuesday: overaccept everything, even the most mundane. Eg. someone says "it’s tuesday", and you go ballistic: "zomg, that’s when my brain surgery is scheduled for!"</li>
<li>Yes But: accept, then add a "but" clause that you make up on the spot. "Is that your dog?" "Yes, but I’m thinking of selling him" "Will you sell him to me?" "Yes, but he‘s expensive"</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, Johnstone’s advise is to follow the rules to see what happens, but not feel responsible for the resulting content. If you improvise spontaneously in front of an audience, you have to accept that your innermost self will be revealed.</p>

<h2>Narrative structure</h2>

<p>Dictionary definition of story: account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment (Google). But it can’t just be a series of facts. Small children ask "and is that the end?" because they feel that a narrative has ended. Why are some stories told, but not others?</p>

<p>A made up sequence of events (eg. “met a bear in the forest, it chased me until I come to a lake, leapt into a boat") is storytelling, but doesn’t constitute a story. There’s no natural place for it to stop since there’s no re-incorporation going on, no cross-referencing of  previously mentioned happenings. This is kind of an improviser’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun">Chekhov’s Gun</a>.</p>

<p>Some exercises to create stories:</p>

<ul>
<li>(With a kid) try collaborative storytelling, by asking the kid questions as in a choose your own adventure book.</li>
<li>Random story: pretend to have come up with a story, and let the other person “extract" it out of you by having them ask you yes/no questions. But just use a stupid rule like yes if the question ends with a vowel, no if it ends with a vowel, and maybe if it ends in a ‘y’.</li>
<li>Connect the story: have one actor provide multiple unrelated sentences (eg. "It was a cold winter night. The wolves howled in the trees. The concert pianist adjusted his sleeves and began to play. An old lady was shoveling snow by the door.”) and the other synthesize them into something cohesive (eg. “When she heard the piano, the old lady began shoveling snow faster. When she reached the concert hall she cried ‘That pianist is my son!’. Wolves appeared at all the windows and the pianist sprang on to the piano, thick fur growing visibly from under his clothes”)</li>
<li>In general, ^^ can be done with just one person by alternating periods of <em>free association</em> with <em>connection</em>.</li>
<li>List dumps: an easy way of free associating is to just dump lists of words from your head.</li>
<li>Invent characters: put actors in groups of 3 and have them invent a name for a character, then describe what she is like.</li>
<li>Automatic reading: imagine you are reading something from a sheet of paper, or that you are uncovering an old tome of poetry. What does the tome say? All you have to do is read it. (Maybe this works by making it feel like you’re just a conveyance, and the result isn’t coming from your head.)</li>
<li>Experts: one actor is a TV interviewer, the other is an expert. The two are to have a dialog about some ridiculous topic that the interviewer asks about.</li>
<li>Verbal Chase ("Curveball"): again a question asker and responder, but the asker has to be unpredictable. For example "Imagine a box" prompts "What’s in it", but the asker goes another way: "Who put you there?" ”My father”, which anticipates “Why did he put you there”, but instead you go “What’s in there?”. This requires a very skilled asker!</li>
<li>Word at a time (this is amazing): free association to tell a story with multiple people involved. It goes quickly, and each person has to produce a word on their turn. In one variant, a slow person gets kicked out of the circle until just two remain. In another variant, the person who just spoke points to the next person for a word, making it harder.</li>
<li>The exercise above can sometimes lead to really boring stories, so it can help to force crazy situations (eg. a womb, an alien planet)</li>
<li>Rather than "make up a story", play "describe a routine and then interrupt it". (Eg. Little Red Riding hood brings groceries to her grandma, but then ...)</li>
<li>Playwright: one person directs two others in a fake play. If the playwright gets blocked, he asks the others for a suggestion. The goal is to not get blocked. It’s important to keep the focus on what happens onstage, not what happens elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to trick students into believing that content isn’t important and that it looks after itself, or they never get anywhere. It’s the same kind of trick you use when you tell them that their imaginations have nothing to do with them, and they’re in no way responsible for what their mind gives them.</p>

    <title>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling by Ted Chiang</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Ted Chiang wrote a bunch of short stories that aren't published in book form. I
really wish he would sell another anthology. He deserves more recognition, and I
prefer reading physical books.</p>

<p>Here's one recommended by Alex, available <a href="https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang">online</a>.  The premise is that
in the future, a tech giant comes up with a technology called Remem giving
perfect audio-visual recall. You input text by sub-vocalizing, and see the
output immediately in your retinas.</p>

<p>This work is a great example of trying to unpack a complex issue and telling a
compelling story that is very focused on a particular set of technologies and
ideas. Ted could have probably written a non-fiction article about the same
subjects, but it would have been a much less appealing way of getting his ideas
across.</p>

<p>The structure of the story is also interesting: it's written from two
perspectives: one story about the journalist and his daughter, and one
seemingly from left field, of an oral-only Asian people making first contact
with European missionaries. It takes some time to relate the two stories
together, but that's part of the process.</p>

<p>Ted is amazing at retelling how it might have felt to experience writing for the
first time. I especially writing as an analogy to nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Where you or I would see nothing but some disturbed grass, he can see that a
  leopard had killed a cane rat at that spot and carried it off,” his father
  said. Gbegba was able to look at the ground and know what had happened even
  though he had not been present. This art of the Europeans must be similar:
  those who were skilled in interpreting the marks could hear a story even if
  they hadn’t been there when it was told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, justifying the need for spaces between words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could not find the places where words began and ended by listening. The
  sounds a person made while speaking were as smooth and unbroken as the hide of
  a goat’s leg, but the words were like the bones underneath the meat, and the
  space between them was the joint where you’d cut if you wanted to separate it
  into pieces. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another core idea is whether or not perfect recall is desirable. Perfect recall
can be a disability: "At times, he tried to deliberately forget things. He wrote
down numbers he no longer wanted to remember on slips of paper and then burnt
them". And in personal relationships, pursuit of truth may be misguided. Perhaps
the ability to replay a painful conflict would prevent that wounds from ever
healing?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seemed to me that continuous video of my entire childhood would be full of
  facts but devoid of feeling, simply because cameras couldn’t capture the
  emotional dimension of events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another idea: something is lost in writing and in life capture through cameras
and microphones. In the Asian missionary world, the student of writing laments
"The paper version of the story was curiously disappointing.". Memory is
fallible, and without externalizing it, every time it is remembered and retold,
it changes. Oral history is alive, while written history is dead (with caveats).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of me wanted to stop this, to protect children’s ability to see the
  beginning of their lives filtered through gauze, to keep those origin stories
  from being replaced by cold, desaturated video. But maybe they will feel just
  as warmly about their lossless digital memories as I do of my imperfect,
  organic memories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting distinction between semantic memory (knowledge of facts), and
episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences). The former is already
solved today via Wikipedia etc. The latter is on its way to being solved. Maybe
not practical yet because of battery life, but this will probably change in
lifetime.</p>

<p>Quick idea: over-reliance on external memory leads to virtual amnesia in the
absense of an extenral medium. This is already true for writing to some extent. </p>

<p>In the climax of the story, both the future-journalist and past-missionary arcs
twist. When his wife and her mother left them, the journalist-protagonist
recalls his daughter lashing out at him, “You’re the reason she left. You can
leave too, for all I care. I sure as hell would be better off without you.” But
as it turned out, Remem made it clear that he was the one who said those words
to his daughter.</p>

<p>In the Asian missionary arc, the European colonizers force the indigenous
tribes into dividing into seven arbitrary regions (for easier governance), and
there is a tribal dispute over how to draw the lines. The decision came down
to blood lines, and two tribes claimed to both be exclusive decendents of one
lineage. Ultimately, the written record shows which tribe is right, and the
tribal protagonist's tribe ends up losing the dispute.</p>

<p>So, is perfect episodic recall desirable? It's complicated. Ted is incredibly
good at presenting both sides of the argument.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be easy for me to assert that literate cultures are better off than
  oral ones, but my bias should be obvious, since I’m writing these words rather
  than speaking them to you. Instead I will say that it’s easier for me to
  appreciate the benefits of literacy and harder to recognize everything it has
  cost us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, Ted's proxy character, the future-journalist, decides to apologize
to his daughter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I think I’ve found the real benefit of digital memory. The point is not to
  prove you were right; the point is to admit you were wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, why does the story have such a strange title?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regarding the role of truth in autobiography, the critic Roy Pascal wrote, “On
  the one side are the truths of fact, on the other the truth of the writer’s
  feeling, and where the two coincide cannot be decided by any outside authority
  in advance.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two concepts are given indigenous terms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But that doesn’t mean he was lying.” Then Jijingi remembered something about
  the European language, and understood Moseby’s confusion. “Our language has
  two words for what in your language is called ‘true.’ There is what’s right,
  <strong>mimi</strong>, and what’s precise, <strong>vough</strong>. In a dispute the principals say what
  they consider right; they speak <strong>mimi</strong>. The witnesses, however, are sworn to
  say precisely what happened; they speak <strong>vough</strong>. When Sabe has heard what
  happened can he decide what action is mimi for everyone. But it’s not lying if
  the principals don’t speak <strong>vough</strong>, as long as they speak <strong>mimi</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Is That a Fish in Your Ear? by David Bellos</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/is-that-a-fish-in-your-ear-by-david-bellos"/>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>David Bellos drops many interesting tidbits in this book about translation.
Unfortunately, I feel unlikely to retain most of them. Each chapter stands on
its own, which is both good for piecemeal reading, but also feels disjointed.
The book struggles to tie together into an overall narrative.  The author's
erudition is apparent, dropping a million mostly relevant and interesting
references. Sometimes this digresses into an obsession with word games, and the
references can come off as gratuitous and self-serving. Overall I liked it, but
there were also parts I found suspect.</p>

<p>What follows is a correspondingly disjointed account of what I found interesting
from the book:</p>

<p><em>Finding a good match</em>: Ultimately the goal of a translator is to find a good
match. Nobody ever does word for word translation, but sense for sense to match
the audience and medium. In translation, the things to preserve are information
and force. Not number of words, sentence length, placement of punctuation.
Speech interpreters can’t preserve tone, pitch, facial gestures, stamping of
feet, etc. Hofstadter has a <a href="http://www.clementmarot.com/MaMignonne.htm">good
example</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fake translations</em>: Some authors claim to produce a translation but there is no
original. Don Quixote claims to be a translation from Arabic. Others claim to
produce an original but just translate an existing work (Castle of Otranto).
Sometimes to pass censorship, other times to try on an identity, to come off as
more authentic. Dzhambul Dzhabayev was a folk singer who was “translated” into
Russian but actually written from scratch. Soviet Union sought to translate
great poets from Kazakh, Ingush, Dagestani etc, but had to invent them instead.</p>

<p><em>Decorative foreignism</em>: When translating a character from one language to
another, how do you preserve their cultural essence? One approach is to preserve
interjections (eg. Gregor Samsa would have exclaimed "Ach Gott!"), but this only
works when readers are assumed to know some phrases of the other language, so
only for languages that share history (for English, German &amp; French, but not
Chuvash).</p>

<p><em>L1 and L2</em>: Translating into your own native language (L1) vs. translating from
your native language into one you are less familiar with (L2). Most literature
is L1, but things like Engrish is definitely L2.</p>

<p><em>Up vs down translation</em>: Up refers to higher prestige or more readers. Like
translation into French from Russian during the 19th century. Or anything into
English these days. Down is the opposite: translating the Bible from Hebrew to
anything. Translating up tends to remove all traces of the original culture but
down tends to preserve it because its perceived as important.</p>

<p><em>Languages and conquest</em>: Sumerian was the up translation target for 3000 years.
This despite the fact that Sumer was conquered by Akkad, who decided to keep the
language and culture. Similarly, Greek language and culture became dominant
despite conquest by Rome. So the economic military bad political expansion
doesn’t directly relate to cultural dominance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A culturally dominant language is one that maintains significant volumes of
  translation activity between itself and a significant number of languages</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Languages are interesting</em>: Kuuk Thaayorre from Australia lay out ordered
objects from east to west rather than left to right. In Hopi there’s a concept
of evidentials. Words change depending on whether they are in the field of view.
So “the farmer killed the duck” doesn’t have enough info to translate to Hopi.</p>

<p><em>Mistrust and translation</em>: When British PMs talks to French president they each
bring their own interpreter out of fear of imperfect or deceptive performance.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragoman">Turkish dragomans</a> who would make the
Ottoman decrees more palatable to other monarchs. Adage: traddutore/traditore.
(But this may just be a coincidence).</p>

<p><em>Asymmetry of translation</em>: There are few vehicular languages (regional lingua
franca) between which vast majority of translation occurs. There are far more
non-vehicular native tongues. Even among the vehicular there are great
disbalances, eg Swedish gets as much attention as Chinese despite 100x fewer
speakers. English is the dominant language today, 65% of all translations are
from English and 7% are into English. To really do well globally you need to
read and write English. </p>

<p><em>Hub languages</em>: It’s common for English to be used as the inter-language too,
for example for going from Chinese to English to {Finnish, Estonian, Latvian,
etc}. Simultaneous translation also uses a hub and spoke model. Rather than
going N to N languages at the EU, and requiring N^2 interpreters, use a hub
language like German so everyone translates to and from German instead, only
requiring 2N. Bizarre that most translators into English are amateurs, despite
being important in the global translation flow (as a hub language). Translators
into Japanese are revered and have almost author like status. </p>

<p><em>Translation vs. language learning</em>: In India, there was historically very
little translation between regional languages. (Translation is always a crutch
for our inability to quickly learn other languages.)</p>

<p><em>Gestures as a language universal</em>: Moving hands while speaking (not reading
aloud) is done in all languages. Interesting commonality between eating and
speaking, both requiring hands and mouth. Many other examples of universal
gestures: slapping someone on the back, punch to the gut, shrug of shoulders.</p>

<p>Random tidbits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some languages make distinctions between spoken and written words, eg. paroles
vs mots in French.</li>
<li>Adair translated Poe's Raven into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AVoid5/comments/5fb8d8/adairs_translation_of_th_ravn_from_a_void_is/">The Black Bird</a>
without using the letter "e".</li>
<li>Eskimo has 40 words for snow, but English has 40 words for coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>Questionable claims:</p>

<ul>
<li>in German, "spoken word" and "written word" are different words. This doesn't
seem to be true.</li>
<li>Humans are unique in their aptitude to vocal learning. Also not true: bird
songs do it, as do cetaceans and some bats.</li>
<li>Author feels that translation between modalities (eg. book =&gt; movie) is about
as relevant as translating flour into noodles. Cool story.</li>
</ul>

<p>I end with food for thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Babel tells the wrong story. The most likely original use of human speech was
  to be different, not the same.
  [...]
  Languages merge when peoples do.
  [...]
  Translating is a first step towards civilization.</p>

    <title>My Russian Grandmother... by Meir Shalev</title>

        <p>My parents have been longtime Meir Shalev readers, but I haven't gotten around
to reading any of his books yet. Ido's recommendation put me over the edge. I
read "Дело было так" in Russian and was impressed. Shalev is able to take often
mundane family scenes, and spin an incredible story out of them.</p>

<p>The book is written in an almost, but not quite, magical realism style. His
guiding principle is explicitly stated. I’ll call it Shalev’s razor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Эта скучная версия для меня неприемлема. Прежде всего, потому, что я не
  впервой сталкиваюсь с такого рода попытками оспаривать истину. А во-вторых,
  потому, что в таких случаях я всегда руководствуюсь проверенным правилом,
  корни которого лежат, кстати, в мире науки, а не в юриспруденции или в
  литературе. Ученые говорят, что, если какое-то явление допускает несколько
  правдоподобных научных объяснений, следует принять самое простое. Аналогично,
  если какая-то история имеет несколько вариантов и все они выглядят истинными,
  в нашей семье предпочитают самый красивый.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the somewhat exotic Israeli moshav setting, I was surprised at how many
things were familiar to me. The re-circulation of familial expressions,
propensity towards hoarding caused by Soviet-levels of hardship, to immigrant
minimalism.  In one word: Russian Jewish family dynamics.</p>

<p>Most importantly, Shalev writes masterfully, and given the Russian topic,
translation into Russian may have even enhanced the experience.</p>

    <title>The neurochemistry of music</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/neurochemistry-music"/>
    
    <updated>2017-10-23T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/neurochemistry-music</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mozart-Effect-Tapping-Strengthen-Creative/dp/0060937203">“The Mozart Effect”</a> on a whim, at Powell’s in Portland,
hoping that it would provide some insights (via well conducted scientific
studies) of how music affects the mind and the body. Unfortunately what I found
was a bunch of woo woo with very little substantiation in the scientific realm.
In some of the first words of the book, the author claims that he made a blood
clot in his brain disappear by humming, praying, and envisioning a vibrating
hand on the right side of his skull. The book has already been <a href="http://skepdic.com/mozart.html">widely
discredited</a>, but I remain fascinated by the effects of music.
I read somewhere that music is possibly the strongest non-chemical intervention
for people, with the possible exception of exercise.</p>

<p>I stumbled on Daniel Levitin, author of a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession/dp/0452288525">"This is Your Brain on
Music"</a>, through a podcast. Burned by The Mozart Effect, I thought
that a less popular, more academic survey might be a quicker way to ramp up, and
found <a href="https://daniellevitin.com/levitinlab/articles/2013-TICS_1180.pdf">this paper on his blog</a>, published in Trends in Cognitive Science.
The paper is a bit challenging for me, being mostly ignorant about
neurophysiology and neurochemistry, but is well written, and includes helpful
glossaries and appendices.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, the authors provide an interesting summary of limitations in
previous music-neuroscience studies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inconsistent experimental methods because of variability in:
<ul>
<li>Type of intervention (passive listening vs performance)</li>
<li>Type of music (usually only binary: stimulating vs relaxing)</li>
<li>Locus of control (experimenter selected vs participant selected)</li>
<li>Social context (individual vs group vs guided intervention)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No standard means of selecting musical stimuli.</li>
<li>No nonmusical control group.</li>
</ul>

<p>The paper also briefly covers some claims related to the Mozart Effect and
admonishes it for lack of control group. Maybe music has a positive effect
because it brings pleasure, and so anything that brings pleasure will have the
same "Mozart Effect"? Rather than doing nothing, group B should be doing
something equally pleasant.</p>

<p>Along similar lines, paper suggests recommends for future research, and includes
a cool diagram:</p>

<p><img src="future.png" alt="Future research in neurochemistry + music." /></p>

<p><style type="text/css">
    ol { list-style-type: upper-alpha; }
</style></p>

<ol>
<li>Locus of control may mediate the effectiveness of music interventions and
therefore its crucial that patients are allowed to choose their own music</li>
<li>Subjective ratings of musical features (sad, happy etc) should be recorded by
the participant instead of relying on experimenter. </li>
<li>include a parallel non music experimental condition to control for mood
induction, attention capture, intention and valence. In this case music is
compared with a tv program and a book. </li>
<li>psycho measurements (eg. imaging, biometrics) provide an essential objective
counterpart to subjective measures in B. </li>
</ol>

<p>Nice survey of studies and their findings about whether the musical intervention
increased hormone secretion. This is where a better understanding of
neurochemical systems would help.</p>

<ul>
<li>Epinephrine - also known as adrenaline, plays an important role in the
fight-or-flight response.</li>
<li>Norepinephrine - also called noradrenaline, general function is to mobilize
the brain and body for action.</li>
<li>Interleukin 6 - secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune
response.</li>
<li>Immuniglobulin A - an antibody that plays a crucial role in the immune
function of mucous membranes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a more complete list of domains mapping to chemical systems?</p>

<p>An <a href="mockel.pdf">interesting study</a> compared the effects of silence, a waltz by
J. Strauss, a modern classic by H. W. Henze, and meditative music by R.
Shankar. Meditative music (Shankar) lowered plasma cortisol, noradrenaline and
t-PA concentrations.</p>

<p>How does music regulate all of these things? One possibility the authors suggest
is that music modulates brainstem mediated measures like heart rate, blood
pressure, body temperature, etc. Stimulating music tends to increase
cardiovascular measures, relaxing vise versa. </p>

<p>One more fascinating tidbit to be explored further: the authors casually drop
this gem: “this follows given that brainstem neurons tend to fire synchronously
with tempo”. This entrainment is described more in <a href="griffiths.pdf">this paper</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I think of it, the brainstem is probably the most interesting part of
the brain in terms of neurological control. According to Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brainstem also plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac and
  respiratory function. It also regulates the central nervous system, and is
  pivotal in maintaining consciousness and regulating the sleep cycle. The
  brainstem has many basic functions including heart rate, breathing, sleeping,
  and eating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting...</p>

    <title>On the Shortness of Life</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Seneca lies at the intersection of Roman history, stoic philosophy and Buddhism.
Despite many endorsements, I haven’t had the time to sit down and read any of
his writings. So I picked up this short volume of three letters, two to his
friends and one to his mother. </p>

<p>There are almost no clarifying notes in the book, no context about Seneca's
life, events he references, or any of the many names he mentions in supporting
his points with exemplars. The Wikipedia page provided some of that, but I
missed having annotations in the book.</p>

<p>Overall the letters are very quotable and read easily, with the exception of a
few convoluted sentences. I was surprised by how modern ancient Rome sounds,
with a surprising plurality of cultures &amp; peoples. Seneca himself was born in
Córdoba and moved to Rome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are Greek cities doing in the midst of barbarian territories? Why do we
  hear the Macedonian language among Indians and Persians? Scythia and all that
  wide region of fierce and untamed tribes reveal Achaean cities established on
  the shores of the Pontus. [...] Tyrians live in Africa, Phoenicians in Spain;
  Greeks penetrated into Gaul and Gauls into Greece; the Pyrenees did not block
  the passage of the Germans...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of the letters are dedicated to the fallacy of material attachment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Petty is the mind which delights in earthly things: it should be led away to
  those things which appear everywhere equally[...] Fate has cast you into a
  land where the most luxurious shelter is a hut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the inevitability of loss, Seneca suggests to celebrate that which is
always with you, the human mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be
  neither given nor taken away. The world you see, nature's greatest and most
  glorious creation, and the human guide, which gazes and wonders at it, and is
  the most splendid part of it, these are our own everlasting possessions and
  will remain with us as long as we ourselves remain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite great advice, Seneca is often accused of profound hypocrisy because he
himself was a very wealthy man and as a teacher of Emperor Nero, who was famous
for his tyrannical reign. Seneca can also come off very curmudgeonly as he
disparages those that don’t live according to his standards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They seek to stock their pretentious kitchens by hunting beyond the Phasis,
  and they aren't ashamed to ask for birds from the Parthians, from whom we have
  not yet exacted vengeance. From all sides they collect everything familiar to
  a fastidious glutton. From the furthest sea is brought food which their
  stomachs, weakened by a voluptuous diet, can scarcely receive. They vomit in
  order to eat, and eat in order to vomit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall a worthy, very quotable read, a peek into the world of Seneca's Rome,
while contemporary sounding in some ways, also quaint and antiquated, for
example in their celestial worldview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun glides constantly, moving on from place to place, and although it
  revolves with the universe its motion is nevertheless opposite to that of the
  firmament itself: it races through all the signs of the zodiac and never
  stops; [...] All the planets forever move round and pass by: as the
  constraining law of nature has ordained they are borne from point to point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll have to revisit more of his writings, perhaps Letter to Lucretius next?</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Ted's formula is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arrive at an interesting era, event, myth, legend, etc.</li>
<li>Come up with an interesting conceptual twist on it.</li>
<li>Research the hell out of the above.</li>
<li>Write a super engaging and interesting short story, focusing more on the
human aspect than the technology (soft sci-fi).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tower of Babylon</strong> Such a great concept: what was the tower going to be like,
according to the semi mythical Babylonians? That there would be inhabitants of
the tower, regions of intense heat next to the sun, areas where the sun might
shine upward, or shooting stars might hit the tower, all require an incredible
imagination and intimate knowledge of the ancients worldview. All written in a
tone of biblical knowledge: cubits, references to the recent deluge, and the
proper use of the Lord's name. Tim also displays impressive knowledge of ancient
building and mining techniques. This ability to pack all of this imagination,
history, and credibility into a short story, and make it incredibly entertaining
to boot, is very impressive.</p>

<p><strong>Understand</strong> superintelligent humans? Also interesting and totally original.
Lots of overla with rationalist obsession with superintelligent ais. Chiang
convincingly describes the sorts of discoveries a superintelligent being might
make. Physics unification, broad psychological insights, hacking ability,
fundamental number theory advances. Also interesting is the protagonists (teds?)
fascination with physical self control through mental means which has become an
interest of mine recently. The whole story is incredibly cinematic especially
the last part involving a psychic battle between superintelligent brains. </p>

<p><strong>Division by Zero</strong> A very experimental format which is presented in triads: 1.
A mathematical fact, 2. A’s prepsective on being terminally depressed due to a
mathematical discovery, 3. B’s perspective on falling out of love with A. My
take from talking with Sarah was this isn’t effective, especially for
non-mathematicians, especially since A is so hard to relate to. But my reading
of the story was that normal people are supposed to relate to B’s experience
(3), and try to infer that the now lost love B had for A mirrors the now lost
love A had for Math. Overall interesting but not my favorite.</p>

<p><strong>Story of Your Life</strong> The basis for Arrival, which I saw and enjoyed when it
came out. The short story is significantly different from the film, in plot and
feeling. It is much more contemplative, much less action oriented. There is no
global military crisis, no scary alien ship with a mysterious gravitational
field, just quiet contemplation and a lot of Heptapod linguistics. Again, great
concept, and an interesting foray into the complex relationship between language
and thought, where the Sapir wharf hypothesis is taken to an insightful extreme.
I think there’s a lot to find for the free-will skeptic as well. Again, I think
the experimental format (alternating between raising her child, and her work)
had more to offer than I could gleam on my first reading. Definitely worth a
re-read in the future.</p>

<p><strong>72 letters</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What is Chartist reform? A British working class movement dating to 1838.</li>
<li>What’s a cucurbit? A sort of gourd, similar to a cucumber. </li>
<li>Der Zauberlehring? This is Goethe’s poem “The Sourcerer’s Apprentice”, which
is the basis for Disney's Fantasia. </li>
</ul>

<p>Very clever integration of the significance of names and Jewish themes:
Kabbalah, Golems. Again, Ted’s writing is very convincing, as if he is well
studied in the fields he references. Is there a thing called “method writing”,
as in “method acting”? In one interpretative mapping, this story comes off as
transparent. Stratton, the young sculptor (roboticist) is more interested in the
nomenclature (software) of golem-like automata (robots) than he is in the
sculpting (hardware, manufacturing). By the time he grows up, he gets a job at
Coade Manufactory (heh, Code Manufactory! Google?), and is able to automate the
practice of sculpting, by creating automata that can sculpt. His goals are
noble: to make it very cheap to do menial labor and make ordinary people’s lives
better (modern automation). This also gets him noticed by the government, or
perhaps some higher order think-tank (Lord Fieldhurst), who sponsors his
research, but also has a goal of his own: to ensure the survival of humanity
(lots of X-risk problems). Simultaneously, Stratton has to wrangle with
sculptors (manufacturers), who are concerned that automation will take their
jobs away (sound familiar?), and eventually plot to kill him. Lord Fieldhurst
ends up having a darker motive, which isn’t just the survival of humanity but
also to ensure the quality of the human race (harkening to eugenics). An
unexplained element in this view is Roth, a Kabbalist (academic? Religious
leader?), who dies but leaves Stratton a piece of the puzzle to solving his
riddle (general AI?).</p>

<p><strong>Hell is the Absence of God</strong> the Christian God definitely exists, and this is
constantly re-affirmed when angels come down and meddle in human affairs.
Ultimately this turns out to be almost mundane, since there is no room left for
uncertainty, and thus belief. A Job-like hero is born with a deformity, and
loses his wife to an angelic intervention. Yet he still cant bring himself to
love God enough to be sent to heaven, where he would be reunited with his
beloved wife.  In an odd twist, hell ends up being just like the regular world,
except there is no godly intervention. In other words, hell is like our world.</p>

<p><strong>Liking what you see: a documentary</strong> We have developed neurostat, a technology
that lets you block certain neural pathways completely, or developing an
“agnosia”. This is being used for blocking the perception of beauty (mostly
facial) in children and young adults, to make them “beauty-blind”, and accept
people for who they are underneath, and not judge them by their appearances.
This is called “calliagnosia”. The story is fascinatingly written as an actual
documentary, with various actors taking their turn to say their piece. At the
center is a college aged girl and her ex-boyfriend, both of whom grew up with
cali. At college she decided to turn it off and realized that she was beautiful,
and her ex-was ugly. Despite this she loves him and wants to get back together
by convincing him to also turn off Cali and seducing him through her beauty.
This ultimately fails, as after turning Cali off, he decides that he isn’t happy
with his own appearance and opts back into Cali. Their love story is punctuated
with a plurality of other voices, from classmates to university presidents to
neuroscientists who provide unique perspectives, explain technical details, etc.
Overall I think the format is effective, presenting the complexity of the issue,
and I’m not left with a strong opinion favoring one side or another. However my
prior is against mental manipulation...</p>

      <div>
        <p>I was catching up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_(band)">Leningrad</a> while reading this book (thanks Vitya),
and found the combination of the two to be very powerful. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz0pUMN7i7w">song about Prada
bags</a> is great, as are many others, but didn't see easily accessible
English subtitles. I don’t have much to add, but here are some excerpts that I
found to be extremely powerful:</p>

<p>Vivid description of the influx of huge cash in Russia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cash has come so fast, like glitter shaken in a snow globe, that it feels
  totally unreal, not something to hoard and save, but to twirl and dance in
  like feathers in a pillow fight and cut like paper-mache into different,
  quickly changing masks. At 5:00am, the music goes faster and faster, and in
  the throbbing, snowing night the cattle [telki] become the Forbeses and the
  Forbeses cattle, moving so fast now they can only see the traces of themselves
  caught in the strobe across the dance floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the accompanying faux chique of the nouveau riche:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the ground floor is a spa done up in a faux Roman style with Doric plaster
  columns and ruins, frequented by languid, leggy girls here to deepen already
  deep tans and have endless manicures and pedicures. The manicures are
  elaborate: rainbow-colored, multilayered, glitter-dusted designs of little
  hearts and flowers, so much brighter than the girls’ bored eyes, as if they
  pour all their utopias into the tiny spaces of their nails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mom and Galia’s Forum experience was probably the Landmark Forum, which is a
close relative of the Lifespring movement, which Pomerantsev highlights in his
book, as a potential cause of depression and suicide for several models featured
in the book. These organizations terrify me.</p>

<p>The topic of Russia fascinates me not just because of multiple generations of my
ancestors living there, but also as a view into human nature, perhaps at its
most extreme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This has always been the paradox of the new Russian nationalism: on one hand
  wanting to conquer all regions around, on the other wanting an ethnically pure
  great power. And all that comes out of this confusion is an ever-growing
  anger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well described profoundly split personality of Russian people: it’s not that
some are dissidents and others are believers, it’s that a single person can
embody both, at different times. This is a super fascinating of people In
general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great drama of Russia is not the "transition" between communism and
  capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that
  during the final decades of the USSR, no one believed in communism and yet
  carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of
  simulations. For this remains the common, everyday psychology: the Ostankino
  producers who make news worshiping the President in the day and then switch on
  an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists
  who morph from role to role with liquid ease- a nationalist autocrat one
  moment and a liberal aesthete the next [Surkov], the "orthodox" oligarchs who
  sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism— and keep their money and
  families in London. All cultures have differences between “private" and
  "public" selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be extreme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also terrifyingly effective is his depiction of bureaucrats:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They conjure motions to “ban untraditional sex” or “ban English words”— and to
  sanction Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Glance through the careers of these new
  religious patriots, and you find they were recently committed democrats and
  liberals, pro-Western, preaching modernization, innovation, and commitment to
  Russia’s European course, before which they were all good Communists. And
  though on the one hand their latest incarnations are just new acts in the
  Moscow political cabaret, something about their delivery is different from the
  common Russian political performer who gives his rants with a knowing wink and
  a nod. Flat and hollow-eyed, as if they have been turned and twisted in so
  many ways they’ve spun right off the whirligig into something clinical.
  Because isn’t some sort of madness implicit in the system? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter ends with a warning, uttered by a British investor in Russia, which
resonates strongly with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We used to have this self-centered idea that western democracies were the end
  of evolution, and we’re dealing from a position of strength, and people are
  becoming like us. It’s not this way. The whole of western civilization, "this
  is fragile".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Super well written, incredibly engaging throughout. Incredibly so for
non-fiction about a depressing topic. Much more entertaining than Gessen’s
barrage of pessimism.</p>

    <title>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</title>

    <link href="/books/benjamin-franklin-an-american-life"/>
    
    <updated>2017-08-24T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/benjamin-franklin-an-american-life</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography, which I recalled enjoying
thoroughly. Having always been an uncritical fan of Benjamin Franklin (BF), I
decided to remedy that. I found the book engaging at first, as his origin story
was revealed. BF's middle age spanned several hundred pages, and really dragged
on. The sheer number of names dropped by Isaacson made this especially
challenging. I abandoned the book for several months, only to come back to it in
August.  The last third of the book picked up again, as we returned to actually
interesting historical events (US independence, the war, the American
Constitution, etc). The conclusion, a whirlwind account of how public opinion on
BF shifted over history, was masterfully written, but overall the book is too
long and detailed for my taste.</p>

<p>Franklin's pragmatism is super appealing to me: "God is very good to us. Let us
show our sense if His goodness by continuing to do good to our fellow
creatures". A few interesting factoids from his early life:</p>

<ul>
<li>BF believed in Deism: a compelling alternative to atheism (agnosticism is too
weak a statement to be in the running).</li>
<li>His activism around constructing libraries was super compelling.</li>
<li>His Junta developed in parallel to the Freemasonry movement.</li>
<li>BF eventually joined the masons and became head of their chapter in
Philadelphia.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me personally, BF's least appealing trait was his consistent inability to
maintain long lasting personal relationships. Franklin's biggest strength is
being a well rounded humanist, but also a prolific inventor. Here is a random
sample of his inventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A table that could be raised and lowered</li>
<li>Using oil to calm turbulent water</li>
<li>An improved convection oven</li>
<li>How to ride the Gulf Stream, and what causes it</li>
<li>Methods for removing smoke from a fireplace (while cooking)</li>
<li>A mechanical arm to retrieve books from upper shelves in a tall bookcase</li>
<li>Lightning rods</li>
</ul>

<p>I also found Isaacson's coverage around pre-constitutional debates very
interesting. Here's a sampling of the issues, and where Franklin landed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should there be one chamber or two (two, BF wanted one)</li>
<li>Should there be a president or an executive council (president, BF wanted council)</li>
<li>Should the president be paid (yes, BF wanted no)</li>
<li>Should judges be elected or appointed (appointed, BF wanted elected)</li>
<li>Should there be term limits on the president? (yes, like BF wanted)</li>
<li>Should the president be impeachable (yes, like BF wanted)</li>
<li>Should representatives be elected based on popular vote or state appointment?
(it's complicated...)</li>
</ul>

<p>At least in word, Franklin was humble and pragmatic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged, by
  better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on
  important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It
  is therefore that, the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own
  judgement and pay more respect to the judgement of others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And created environments for others to do the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Franklin’s shaded garden was a place where controversies could be cooled.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His epitaph, attributed to a French minister, says it all: eripuit coelo fulmen
sceptrumque tyrannis ("He seized lightning from the heavens and the scepter from
tyrants").</p>

    <title>Whole Earth Discipline by Stewart Brand</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/whole-earth-discipline-by-stewart-brand"/>
    
    <updated>2017-07-12T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/whole-earth-discipline-by-stewart-brand</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>In the spirit of the Whole Earth Catalog, this book reads more like an extended
blog post than a non-fiction book, mainly because it covers so much material at
a pretty high level. I feel like each chapter is a well crafted summary of at
least five other books cited in the end-notes. This is not a complaint;
synthesis is where Stewart Brand shines.</p>

<p>The basic thesis of the book is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cities, nuclear power, and genetic engineering are good for the environment.</li>
<li>Geoengineering is probably necessary to mitigate global warming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About cities</h2>

<ul>
<li>Slums are vibrant, starting flimsy but then becoming a lot more substantial.
In India, slums are 1/6 of GDP! Informal economy is huge.</li>
<li>80-90% of GNP growth happens in cities. Cities only take up 2.8% of the
world’s landmass, but house half of its people. Birth rate goes down.</li>
<li>Geoff West on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law">Kleiber’s law</a>:
Individual productivity rises superlinearly (eg. When a city doubles in size,
productivity increases more than 2x). Note that this is different for
companies, and for individuals.</li>
<li>Brand claims the Russian birth rate is 1.14, and the average Russian woman has
seven abortions. This seems too high, and more recent data says a birth rate
of 1.4, but apparently Russia does have the highest number of abortions per
woman of child bearing age.</li>
<li>Density =&gt; Green. NYC is the greenest city in the US by many metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About nuclear power</h2>

<ul>
<li>Baseload refers to a solid guaranteed source of power that can operate at all
times and doesn’t require storage. Wind and solar have that down side.</li>
<li>If all of the energy you were to use in a life time (1 GW year), were stored,
it would amount to 20 tons if nuclear (stored in dry storage casks), and 8
million tons (directly into the air) if coal. Nuclear is on par
(environmentally) with solar and wind.</li>
<li>Apparently no birth defects are attributed to Chernobyl or to Hiroshima. Also
Chernobyl death count is much lower than I expected, at 56. Brand glosses over
any cancer related deaths, which according to wikipedia are ~4,000.</li>
<li>Main cost of Chernobyl and nuclear in general (except Japan bombs) fear of
radiation takes a much bigger toll than the radiation itself.</li>
<li>Even more crazy is this idea of Hormesis which is that low dose radiation is
good for you. But this sounds like crockery, highly unverified.</li>
<li>EPA has very severe thresholds for radiation exposure for people, requiring
nuclear sites lower exposure to under 15 mrem of radiation per year. But
this is far lower than background radiation in many places. 284 mrem in
Connecticut or 364 mrem in Colorado or 13k mrem in Ramsar, Iran.</li>
<li>Most of France’s energy is provided by Nuclear (54 reactors), and they have
very clean air.</li>
<li>Lots of new developments in nuclear reactors, lots more uranium in the soil,
prospects to use thorium (which can’t be used for weapons?). Also,
smaller scale underground reactors are coming up.</li>
<li>In Sweden, 1/3 of the population has toured a nuclear plant. This is a good
way of increasing public acceptance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About genetic engineering</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mendelian selection has been happening for ages. Chemical mutagenesis and then
nuclear metagenesis, where plants get exposed to large amounts of radiation in
order to encourage mutation, has also been common. These approaches are
random, sometimes cause downsides. </li>
<li>With GE you can do much more tailored, fine-grained tweaks. “Like getting a
spouse without in-laws, while breeding is like getting a spouse with a whole
village”.</li>
<li>Half of corn in US is GE. Half the sugar comes from GE beets. A quarter of new
drugs are made with GE. 90% of Hawaiian papayas are GE.</li>
<li>GE crops are engineered for pest and disease resistance, meaning less
fertilizer is necessary, which is healthier and better for the environment.</li>
<li>GE foods are exhaustively vetted for safety, making them safer than
conventional food. Billions have eaten GE food and not gotten sick.</li>
<li>Rift between Europeans and Americans. EU simply don’t want to eat GE foods. GE
is beneficial for farmers, but consumers are opposed out of fear? Again Marin
county leads the way: “Our children should not be used as guinea pigs for
genetic engineering”.</li>
<li>How Monsanto works: glyphosate kills all plants but safe for animals. But
Monsanto’s seeds are engineered by be glyphosate resistant. So spray
glyphosate on fields and kill all of the weeds quickly. </li>
<li>Similar technique involves adding Bacillus thuringenesis (Bt) to crops, which
is poisonous only to larvae. Bt corn and cotton are examples, and need way
less pesticides.</li>
<li>Also with GE you can till less, which keeps carbon naturally stored in the
earth from escaping.</li>
<li>Bad PR for Monsanto about enslaving farmers comes from the practice of
engineering sterility into seeds so that farmers are required to go back to
Monsanto for fresh seeds every year. But apparently farmers generally buy new
seeds on a yearly basis anyway (but this begs the question of why Monsanto
would want to engineer sterility in the first place).</li>
<li>Good to remember that Monsanto has competitors and that if they end up being
malicious, farmers can easily find alternatives.</li>
<li>Also possible to use GE to enhance nutrition in otherwise nutritionally empty
food. Examples: golden rice augmented with beta carotene, same with
BioCassava which provides vitamin A, E, iron, zinc, free of cyanide and can
store longer than regular cassava.</li>
<li>Overly euro-centric NGOs in Africa (little rain, hot) tend to bring crops that
thrive in Europe (lots of rain, cold). Also Europe is anti-GE which doesn’t
help Africa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to mitigate global warming</h2>

<p>Renewistan is a hypothetical future dystopia that would result from us fully
replacing conventional energy with renewable energy. This is not sufficiently
efficient to be practical.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Steven salter autonomous water particle sprayer with flettner sails. Would
brighten clouds to offset a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. </p></li>
<li><p>SO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. This happened naturally due to a volcanic
explosion at Pinotubo in which 20M tons of so2 reduced earths temperature by
0.5C. </p></li>
<li><p>Feed iron to carbon fixing algae to make them bloom. Unclear if this will
work. Good case: algae sinks to bottom acting like carbon sink. Bad case:
circulates in food webs near surface and returns to atmosphere. </p></li>
<li><p>Floating vertical pipes to drive cool nutrient rich water from depths upward,
while pumping CO<sub>2</sub> and dimethyl sulphide (which makes sun reflective clouds)
down. Using wave energy to do the work. </p></li>
<li><p>Mixing non biodegradable biochar with soil you can ensure that the CO<sub>2</sub> within
it doesn't escape. Essentially you're growing plants which takes CO<sub>2</sub> and then
burning them into biochar, keeping the c sequestered. </p></li>
<li><p>Artificial trees that capture a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> a day chemically and use it for
commercial stuff. </p></li>
<li><p>Large sunglasses at L1 orbit to reduce the amount of heat from the sun
directly. </p></li>
<li><p>CROPS: sequester agricultural residues with bales at the bottom of the ocean.
(Another idea I've heard is doing something similar but sending the waste to
space using s railgun)</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Cross cutting ideas</h1>

<ol>
<li>Critique of precautionary principle, which is a doctrine against meddling
regardless of risks and rewards. Fable of the steak knives (formulated by
Jimmy Wales): </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You want to design a restaurant, and you think to yourself, “Well, in this
  restaurant we’re going to be serving steak. And since we’re going to be
  serving steak, we’re going to have steak knives, and since we’re going to have
  steak knives, people might stab each other. How do we solve this problem?
  We’re going to have to build cages around each table to make sure no one stabs
  each other.“ - Jimmy Wales</p>
  
  <p>“Expected benefits from any act are finite and known: “Golden rice will
  prevent blindness in children.” Imagined problems are infinite and unknown:
  “Golden rice might cause poor people to stop eating green vegetables; it might
  lead to excess vitamin A consumption; it might be a Trojan horse for corporate
  takeover; it might cause who knows what prob-­ lems!” In this formulation, no
  good surprises are possible, all bad surprises are probable, and intended
  consequences are never what actually happen”</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Ideologically motivated environmentalists cause a lot of harm. For example
Greenpeace’s anti GE activity has harmed developing world, leading to large
scale famines. At the same time "romantics" are given their due for inspiring
the masses to care about the environment, yet it's clear why they are at odds
with science and engineering. </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It's fortunate that there are so many romantics in the movement, because they
  are the ones who inspire the majority in most developed societies to see
  themselves as environmentalists. But that also means that scientists and their
  perceptions are always in the minority; they are easily ignored, suppressed,
  or demonized when their views don't fit the consensus story line."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Environmentalists were against space exploration but it turned out to be a big
deal because satellites were instrumental for ocean monitoring and the photo of
earth from space motivated huge interest in ecology. </p>

<ol>
<li>Concentrate harm geographically. Cities &gt; sprawl, nuclear waste &gt; coal waste,
high yield &gt; low yield crop. Wall off the artificial from the natural. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Random interestingnesses</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Darwin's solution to confirmation bias: "write down every piece of evidence
that appears to contradict your beliefs, because otherwise they disappear from
your mind".</p></li>
<li><p>Brand makes an example out of being wrong in public. He calls for more foxes
to hold their opinions more strongly and for audiences to be more open to
opinion change. </p></li>
<li><p>Fascinating angle on European-native American collision: that the indigenous
population of the continent fell from 50-100M in 1491 to 7M by 1650? "Far
from destroying pristine wilderness, Europeans bloodily created it".
Apparently indigenous agriculture was in 2/3 of the US, coastal forests were
cut down for farms, salmon nets covered most northwest streams, Indian fires
abounded. TODO: Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1491-Revelations-Americas-Before-Columbus/dp/1400032059">Charles Mann, New Revelations Before

    <title>The Psychology of Curiosity</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read <a href="http://int-des.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PsychofCuriosity.pdf">an academic paper on curiosity</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Loewenstein">George Loewenstein</a>.
It was surprisingly readable and very insightful.</p>

<p>Why did I read it? Just like <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/events/papert/">some</a> think about thinking, others
are curious about curiosity. More specifically, I recently read a <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/2/1/14392290/partisan-bias-dan-kahan-curiosity">Vox
article</a> that suggested "The more scientifically curious people are, the
more they are immune to the power of partisan thinking". What follows is mostly
a summary of the article, as well as some sketches I made to help me understand
it better.</p>

<p>Dark side of curiosity (it can be a vice):</p>

<ul>
<li>Stories of Pandora's Box, Eve's Garden, Lot's Wife's Pillar.</li>
<li>St. Augustine: "Ocular Lust"</li>
<li>Hume: love of knowledge vs. passion for gossip?</li>
<li>Exploratory non-sanctioned behaviors are often curiosity driven: drugs &amp; sex.</li>
</ul>

<p>Berlyne's types of curiosity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perceptual curiosity: drive for novel stimuli</li>
<li>Diversive curiosity: a more general stimulation seeking behavior linked to boredom</li>
<li>Specific curiosity: desire for a particular piece of information</li>
<li>Epistemic curiosity: a general human desire for knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>Unclear if perceptual &amp; diversive curiosity should be called curiosity, or
something else?</p>

<p>Trait vs. state curiosity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the distinction meaningful? (eg. Do you usually find the rooms you are in
to be too bright? vs. Is the room you are in too bright?)</li>
<li>No strong demographic correlates for trait curiosity.</li>
<li>State curiosity is way more interesting to study since "an improved
understanding of state curiosity, in contrast, has the potential to suggest
practical methods of stimulating curiosity in the broader population."</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="intrinsic-vs-extrinsic.jpg" alt="Intrinsic vs. extrinsic curiosity." /></p>

<p>Curiosity and sex:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freud suggests that curiosity is a proxy for sexual curiosity, which is
suppressed by society.</li>
<li>In some rare cases, this is manifest as a general curiosity about the world.</li>
<li>But this theory is non-falsifiable (fuck yeah Popper / eat shit Freud).</li>
<li>Like sex, curiosity is an intense desire for information, but once attained,
is often disappointing (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-coital_tristesse">postcoitus triste</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Existing explanations for curiosity</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Curiosity as a drive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analogy to hunger and thirst: "appetite/thirst for knowledge", curiosity
can be satisfied.</li>
<li>It's per object (eg. satisfied curiosity about invertebrates), unlike food
where it's a general feeling of satiation.</li>
<li>Also unlike food, there's no "tissue need or deficit external to the
nervous system".</li>
<li>"Meta drive", since it's not the drive for the information directly, but
the drive for the desire to seek information (eg. an ape that opens the
window to see if there's something interesting there)</li>
<li>Also curiosity is easily disrupted by "tissue needs" like hunger and
thirst.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Incongruity theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Curiosity caused by violated expectations (Piaget, Hebb, Hunt)</li>
<li>Sweet spot / optimal level of incongruity. Too much incongruity =&gt; fear /
can't relate / can't incorporate new information.</li>
<li>Motivation: to resolve uncertainty. "Human nature abhors a lack of
predictability and the absense of meaning"</li>
<li>Also related to "Need for Cognition" which is more of a personality trait.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Competence motive: Curiosity may result from wanting to master one's
environment. This doesn't super compelling to Loewenstein (and me by
association).</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Situational causes for state curiosity</h1>

<p>Paradox: curiosity seeking behavior doesn't make sense if people are curiosity averse. </p>

<p>Sweet spot of expectation violation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too little expectation violation =&gt; bored.</li>
<li>Too much expectation violation  =&gt; overwhelmed. </li>
<li>So the in this model, the goal is to maximize the curiosity level.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="expectation-violation.jpg" alt="Upside down U curve of ideal level of expected
violations." /></p>

<p>Conceptual controversy increases curiosity (experiment where students were put into groups intended to either foster conflict or consensus: 45% of controversy kids gave up recess to watch a film, vs. 18% in consensus group).</p>

<h1>Loewenstein's model: information gap</h1>

<p>Information gap: </p>

<ul>
<li>The gap between what you know (objective situation) and what you want to know
(the reference point).</li>
<li>Just like material wealth where it's hard to compare cars to swimming pools so
we use $, knowledge is multidimensional but can be reduced to 1D via bits
(info theory)</li>
<li>Also like material wealth, we rarely want to compare to unattainable (eg. the
rich and famous), but instead to your neighbor.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="information-gap.jpg" alt="1D information gap" /></p>

<p>Quantifying the info gap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sensitivity to both relative and absolute magnitude of the info gap.</li>
<li>Gap between knowing 4 of 5 Pacific Ocean-bordering US states &gt; gap between
knowing 49 and 50 of US states.</li>
<li>Gap between knowing 40 of 50 US states &gt; gap between 4 of 5 Pacific Ocean
bordering states.</li>
<li>But some things affect curiosity that doesn't account in the info theoretic
view of the info gap (eg. facts that bring the plot to life in a murder
mystery.)</li>
<li>Precise measurement of the gap is often unnecessary, just a sense of whether
gap is increasing or decreasing. For research, can rely on self-reports.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Implications of the gap approach</h1>

<p>Subjects prefer more general rules to resolve uncertainty (study: 1. rule
generated list of 5 States vs. 2.  another rule that generated list of 10
states, subjects prefer to learn rule 2.)</p>

<p>More curiosity for insight vs. for incremental problems (study: 1. image-grid
where each cell was part of one animal vs. 2. each cell is its own animal,
subjects open more cells condition 1.)</p>

<p>Two ways of seeing a knowledge gap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Little knowledge =&gt; focus on what you know.</li>
<li>More knowledge =&gt; focus on what you don't know (ie. the information gap).</li>
<li>At some point in between, there's a discrete shift on focusing on ignorance
that makes you more curious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Paradox: if you don't know much, no real drive to learn more. Also, many people
don't know that they don't know a lot (Related to Dunning–Kruger effect.)</p>

<p><img src="curiosity-knowledge.jpg" alt="Curiosity increases with knowledge &amp; discrete shift." /></p>

<p>As a novice gains more knowledge the "unknown unknowns" become known unknowns,
which spurs curiosity. As you learn more, the gap closes and you become less
curious. Until there's a leap, your reference point changes realize your
ignorance again.</p>

<p><img src="curiosity-progression.jpg" alt="Alternating curiosity levels as your reference point
changes." /></p>

<p>A good way to cause awareness of the informational gap is via guessing and
feedback. It's difficult to deny the knowledge gap if you guess an answer
incorrectly. </p>

<p>Combination of guess and feedback increased curiosity (study: one group had to
first guess Easternmost, Northernmost, Southernmost states (w/ immediate
feedback) while the other didn't, and the one that did guess &amp; feedback was more
curious)</p>

<h1>Curiosity inducing stimuli</h1>

<p>Situations that increase curiosity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Direct question (eg. a puzzle or riddle)</li>
<li>A sequence of events with an unknown resolution, desire to complete a script
(eg. they went on a walk at night, suddenly they heard a noise). Q: "What
will happen?" / "Was I right?"</li>
<li>Violation of expectations. Q: "Weird, why did that happen?"</li>
<li>Possession of information by someone else (eg. someone chuckling as he reads
a news article). Q: "What does he know?" </li>
<li>Formerly known but forgotten things (eg. that word that was on the top of the
tongue...). Q: "What was that thing again!"</li>
</ol>

<h1>Conclusions / misc</h1>

<p>Loewenstein calls for more research on state (not trait) curiosity, and more
research on epistemic curiosity.</p>

<p>I should read William James' on scientific curiosity, since it's most relevant
for that Vox article, and also mentioned by Loewenstein as the type of curiosity
that mostly corresponds to specific epistemic curiosity.</p>

<p>I printed the paper, but the last page didn't come out. So I experienced the
recently learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect">Zeigarnik effect</a>: people remember uncompleted or
interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. I was very curious to see how the
paper ended, so had to finish reading the last page online.</p>

    <title>On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/on-tyranny-by-timothy-snyder"/>

    <id>//smus.com/books/on-tyranny-by-timothy-snyder</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>More of a pamphlet than a book, both in brevity and in alarmist urgency. </p>

<p>Structured as a strange combination of trends that lead to tyranny and general
life tips. Dangerous trends include the destruction of institutions and
paramilitary rule. As for life tips, the author suggests reading more books and
longer articles, donating to charities, and having more conversations in person,
and remaining calm in the face of terror. </p>

<p>The last point I think is a good one and I agree that there is good reason to be
deeply concerned about the political impact of a major terror attack on US soil. </p>

<p>Overall quite heavy handed. Despite not calling out Trump by name, some passages
like this one are overly didactic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is patriotism? Let us begin with what patriotism is not. It is not
  patriotic to dodge the draft and to mock war heroes and their families. It is
  not patriotic to discriminate against active-duty members of the armed forces
  in one's companies or to campaign to keep disabled veterans away from one's
  property. It is not patriotic to ... (etc)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each "It is not patriotic" sentence refers to something deplorable Trump did in
the last 6 months. And it continues for a page and a half. A thought flashed
across my mind: how is this better than reading Twitter?</p>

<p>The author draws many false analogies to Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany.
He then normalizes extremist terror as just another thing by claiming that those
resisting fascists and communist regimes were also billed extremists (therefore
what?). He plays with words, uncharitably redefining a "nationalist" in contrast
to "patriot" as one "that encourages us to be the worst and the tells us we are
the best", whereas the two words are often used interchangeably.</p>

<p>The conclusion starts well written, with choice words criticizing "end of
history" narratives that helped get us here. But ends in conspiratorial hand
wringing.</p>

<p>In liberal cities like Seattle, the opposition is the majority and there are no
signs that things will flip any time soon. Most of Trump's policies are
signaling and most of them are counteracted with opposition signaling. He is an
awful leader for this country and I'm ashamed of his words and actions. But as
for actual policy changes or prosecution of specific people, he has (so far)
been stopped at every turn. I agree that these are unusual times, and that extra
vigilance cannot hurt, but hyperbole can be dangerous too. This book feels like
a classic case of crying wolf. I find it hard to believe that it will stand the
test of time. </p>

        <p>Incredibly vividly written. Fascinating to see the self made struggles of people
that are so fantastically well off.  Very unsympathetic characters throughout,
except for the narrator. </p>

<p>Something about Gatsby's lifestyle reminds me of my time in SF. Large house
parties, loose connections, endless networking and small talk.  There is a
certain aimlessness to it that I found very relatable.</p>

    <title>Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/finite-and-infinite-games-by-james-carse"/>
    
    <updated>2017-05-28T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/finite-and-infinite-games-by-james-carse</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I was intrigued by the premise of the book, which introduces a theory of games
(emphatically not the game theory of economics), in which there are two kinds of
games: short, well defined finite ones where the goal is to win, and infinite,
rule-bendy ones where the goal is to keep playing. Great premise but I couldn't
get into it.  Despite being only ~100 small, sparse pages, I had to cut it off
after about twenty. Here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role
  of mother." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this profound or what? My impression is that the author is a deliberate
obscurantist. The whole book reads like a collection of Zen koans. But unlike
koans, which are simple on the surface but attempt conceal something profound,
the surface level is also very dense. The author casually cites Plato, Freud,
Hegel Marx, Jesus, Sartre, Thoreau, Shaw, Proust, etc. The book is full of
passages like the above that are meaningless without defining terms precisely.</p>

<p>Further, the author babbles a lot about theory, rarely producing actual examples
of infinite games. Presumably life is an infinite game, but are there other
examples? What good is a grand theoretical framework that only has one instance?
Lastly, given the author's definition, infinite games seem hardly game-like at
all.</p>

    <title>Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari"/>
    
    <updated>2017-05-28T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I decided to read Homo Deus because I enjoyed Harari's previous book, Sapiens.
The first 2/3 of Homo Deus is basically a rehash and more succinct version of
his previous book. Despite the repetition, I got a lot out of it, mainly because
I listened to Sapiens, so my retention was pretty bad. The last third of the
book was very speculative.</p>

<p>Interesting things from the recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2016, war killed 120k, crime 500k, suicide 800k, diabetes 1500k.</li>
<li>Well stated paradox of knowledge using Marx as an example. Specifically
communist revolutions never came to the western world because its leaders had
read Marx. </li>
<li>Also this logic conveniently defends Homo Deus existence as a way of avoiding
the future it describes. But also of obviating the author from any
responsibilities. Smart :)</li>
<li>Big claim that in 1016 Europe people knew what 1050 would be like (but not 2016,
2050). Not sure if this is just hindsight bias. </li>
<li>Nice crisp description of intersubjectivity, better than in sapiens. </li>
<li>Claim: religion is for control, science is for power. I agree, except
s/science/engineering/.</li>
<li>The Vatican was once an institution for technological progress, a Silicon Valley
type institution. Monasteries did contribute quite a bit to tech innovation,
even recently (e.g. Mendel)</li>
</ul>

<p>Even in the summary, Harari goes on some bizarre but interesting tangents:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several pages railing against lawns. They are purely status symbols and have
no practical value.</li>
<li>Snakes as ancestors. Dragons as wise creatures. Rainbow Serpents of Australian
Aborigines. Eve as a snake. Garden of eden as an anti animist fable.</li>
<li>The Garden of Woolsthorpe (where Newton's apple accident occurred) as a
founding Myth paralleling the garden of eden. This is where newton had his
kinematic revelation. Except rather than being punished for his curiosity like
Adam and Eve were, we have modern science. </li>
<li>Why do we have consciousness when there are so many automatic processes that are
handled by the body and the brain without any conscious intervention?</li>
<li>Weird and tenuous analogy of gods to corporations. Corporations actually
produce output like a product or service but gods are purely fictional. </li>
<li>Judge systems from without. For example a corporation thrives if it makes a lot
of money. But that's not why corporations exist. </li>
</ul>

<p>To transition from the summary to the meat of the book (speculating about the
future), Harari rehashes his branches of humanism:</p>

<ul>
<li>liberal: equality for all, economically artistically etc</li>
<li>social: socialism and communism. Deference to the group. </li>
<li>evolutionary: belief in superiority of some over others. </li>
</ul>

<p>My critique: this is too broad. Humanism seems to include everything that is
non-religious. Because either God is the main thing or humans are the main
thing. Are there other better alternatives? Maybe with Zen Buddhism? </p>

<p>Harari then dives into an overly stark analysis of the weakness of liberalism.
As if the only US allies were dictators during post war period. Not true! Most
of Europe was liberal. And although the Soviet Union was critical in defeating
Nazi Germany, liberal Allies did play a huge role too. Harari then goes into
counterfactuals, suggesting that social humanism (communism) defeated
evolutionary humanism (Nazism) in World War II, and that the Cold War didn't
turn Hot because of mutually assured destruction due to nukes. </p>

<h2>Last third</h2>

<p>The book really begins in Chapter 8, where Harari jumps headlong into future
speculation.  It's unclear to me why Harari jumps to some post humanist fantasy.
Currently we are seeing the resurgence of "evolutionary humanism" in the form of
authoritarian regimes. </p>

<p>Harari is clearly not an expert in AI and overly optimistic about it. He claims
that"computers programmed with ethical algorithms could far more easily conform
to the latest rulings of the international criminal court."</p>

<p>On replacing service type jobs, especially in medicine, over optimism. People
like dealing with people. And the supposedly empathetic machine is still a long
ways off. Even in the case of near perfect replication, I think acknowledging
consciousness and experience on the other side goes a long way. </p>

<p>More reductionist thinking: biology is just an algorithm and we can do
algorithms. Yes it is but the devil is in the details. </p>

<p>He cites a Frey and Osborne study which suggests that all sorts of jobs are
going away. A twenty year horizon cannot reasonably have such precise
probabilities. And many problems with specifics. 98% Sports referee jobs to go
obsolete by 2033? Sure we can tell fowls through video. Who will prevent fights?
Who will make difficult calls? Seems like bullshit. </p>

<p>On self knowledge again Harari goes too far by claiming that your self is the
sum of your biometric data. As long as we don't divulge everything to the
machine, aren't we quite far from this vision? I am surprised that a deep
meditator like the author believes this.</p>

<p>Harari lists several threats to liberalism posed by this hypothetical future
thing:</p>

<p>One threat is that we will lose our agency and become agents of some networked
machine. This is terrifying. We may need some anti-tech revolution to prevent
this. Also it's unclear what the scope would be. I'd like to always be able to
disconnect and go into nature. </p>

<p>Another threat is that the rich will become increasingly intelligent, healthy,
successful, further separating the gap between the rich and the poor.  I believe
that if things get bad enough, the population at large will rebel and
redistribute the spoils more evenly. </p>

<p>Here's why. In established first world countries, the rich know how to behave.
They rarely flaunt their money and mostly blend in with the rest of the world.
I think this is largely a self-preserving strategy. Many of those that don't
follow it aren't respected by giant swaths of the population. For example overly
flashy people are generally considered to be douchebags. Trump is an aberration
and widely hated. Now imagine if he was also some superhuman demigod. Would his
supporters be into that? If a tiny clique of people were visibly richer
healthier, people would rebel. </p>

<p>I think Harari a third point is only viable in an dystopian oligarchy. And if
people have become completely useless, why would some small elite group of
humans still hold the reigns? This scenario folds into the superintellihgence
one. </p>

<p>We use machine strength and machine intelligence augmented tools all the time.
Harari seems to be obsessed with the neural augmentation aspect, but is this
such a game changer?</p>

<p>Good points that are hard to argue against: human loss of smell, attention,
ability to dream. I seek to get it all back. But I wonder: were these all things
that came naturally to everybody in some long forgotten utopia, or did rare
individuals have to work on developing these skills for themselves while the
rest of the population plowed the field or caught the deer? </p>

<ul>
<li>Dreaming: It's no accident that Joseph's dream interpretation was so rare and
that there were commonly priest classes for interfacing with dreams</li>
<li>Smelling: yes seems likely that the masses of the day: hunters and farmers
needed this more long ago. </li>
<li>Attention: also an elite skill I think. We are In an age of distraction but
attention today is more needed than ever before. Attention for a hunter was
focused with adrenaline. Focusing otherwise is and probably was rare. </li>
</ul>

<p>The focus on technology changing our minds and wills seems premature. And by the
way this is why I think SSRIs are a slippery slope. Maybe the google normal
health index can serve as some humanistic baseline for human norms?</p>

<p>The last section is entirely focused on "Dataism". It sounds like he's
describing information theory. I suppose any discipline can already be viewed
through that lens. Except is that activity likely going to produce useful
results? Empirical evidence from science points to no. </p>

<p>Harari claims that the phrase "information wants to be free" means that
the information itself is the actor. This is surprising, since the phrase is not
meant to be taken literally, used as a slogan about increasing human access to
information. A cult of information worship for its own sake? I don't think this
makes sense without actual value to an actual human.</p>

<p>Harari has so far failed to explain who believes in dataism. Maybe some people
in SV appear to, but IoT usually has some actual purpose, like for example,
making things easier to use, or increasing productivity of a farm or factory.
If you lose the thread, you end up with tech for tech's sake (an existing
problem).</p>

<p>Also Harari's stance on the instagram sharing thing is really cynical. Yes
sharing with others is part of it. But many people have taken photos in the
past, for themselves and their friends.  It's clear to me that the value of
Human experience is inherent. Some people are overly addicted to external
validation, but this too is an existing problem.</p>

<p>Throughout the book Harari judiciously uses the word "may". This is good because
man the last third especially is just chock full of wild speculation.  It
strikes me that the way to read this book is as a provocation. Overall I'm left
with the feeling that this was a fast follow for Harari. A lot of the solid
stuff in the first 2/3 of the book is a rehash of Sapiens. The last part was
stimulating but mainly to get me thinking about why I disagree. </p>

        <p>Overall an engaging lecturer and super interesting subject. Would have greatly
informed my trips to Japan. Most of these are quick notes about things that were
new to me:</p>

<p>Lots about Buddhism:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's a super interesting argument that the fact that Shinto traditions are
completely illogical is proof of the divine origin of those teachings. </li>
<li>There were multiple streams of Buddhism commonly practices in early Japan. Pure
Land Buddhism is very similar to Christianity's because of the centrality of
salvation through belief. Also there are multiple streams of Zen Buddhism. One
focuses on koans and the other focuses on meditation.</li>
<li>Key idea of zen gardens is that you get a new view from every step in the
path. This is a metaphor for human nature, which is prone to seeing the world
very differently depending on emotional state. Constant reminder about the
limitation of the senses. </li>
<li>In Pure Land Buddhism, gardens include a bridge to paradise. Dry landscaping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Politics:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Tycoon" comes from tai + kun, a made up title (great lord) for the Japanese
Emperor as a result of a Japanese-Korean treaty. It was invented to avoid direct
vassalage to the Ming. </li>
<li>Interesting oscillation between isolationism and globalism. 1600-1860 was
complete isolation. Hardly knew about the pre-WW2 Japan with Manchurian
ambitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arts</p>

<ul>
<li>Apparently the tea ceremony inspired the English Arts and Crafts movement.
Also a part of minimalism. (Check out Okakuro's "The Book of Tea" from 1906). </li>
<li>(Check out Nou theater but it's unclear if I'll be able to follow it. Not much
interest in Kabuki.)</li>
<li>Haiku is young. Started in 1890. Fascinating idea of pivot words: homonyms that
can be used just once but translated into multiple of its meanings. Also renga
is an interesting chain of poems each written by another poet. </li>
<li>Hokusai invented the comic book. What. </li>
</ul>

<p>Lecturer provides a good summary of why he is interested in Japan: it's
incredibly interesting and exotic, but still has enough western services.</p>

    <title>The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This book attempts to distill authors' previously written and incredibly popular
multi-tome historical "The Story of Civilization" into under 100 pages. Full
disclaimer: I haven't read the original. I found this one is a bit of a mixed
bag. Overall, I say read it, since it's so short (~100 short pages).  I found
the flourishing writing style and strong opinions sometimes leads to funny dated
read. Similar in some ways to Jacob Bronowski writing. </p>

<p>Random but interesting ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freedom and equality are at odds. </li>
<li>Authors seem to rely on group selection. Still unclear what I think about the
idea. </li>
<li>Interesting coverage of the great man theory of history. A nod to both the
causes of greatness in the environment and also personal originality that can
bridge gaps.</li>
<li>Also insight into the yin yang nature of liberal vs conservative
thought. </li>
<li>Interesting that Rome took 500 years to collapse from its nadir in 60 BCE.</li>
<li>Revolutions rarely succeed in redistributing wealth, mainly in destroying it.</li>
<li>In Chapter X, authors express concern about a despot ruining America democracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of interesting thinking on morality and history:</p>

<ul>
<li>In general the idea that morality follows the times.</li>
<li>Intimate relationship between Bible and agriculture. Biblical morals developed
to help with agriculture, and have deteriorated as a result of industry. </li>
<li>Was every vice once a virtue? Pugnacity, brutality, greed, and sexual readiness
were virtues for the hunter age.</li>
<li>The idea that most times in history have been full of sin. Examples from the
Renaissance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things that felt dated and detracted from the experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>The chapters are mostly named "History and <em>_</em>". This obtuse naming gets old
quickly, and skimming the contents is completely useless.</li>
<li>The authors make predictions that geography no longer matters because
airplanes, completely ignoring reality of efficiency. They end pompously on
"man, not earth, makes civilization"</li>
<li>At some points the authors express fear that Catholics will take over US
politics. This is likely top of mind for the authors writing the book the
Kennedy era. I looked up the authors' religious affiliations and they come from
a Jewish background (squee!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The authors allude to some historical patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li>History that is written is different from history that is lived. </li>
<li>The church as an organization that stands above Christian nation states. Kind
of like a religious version of the UN. Like an alternative to the international
system. Except while the International System is really vague and doesn't really
seem to have much power, the Church worked once.</li>
<li>Prevalence of the cycle between religion and atheism. And I think that Sam
Harris is wrong about the end of faith. </li>
<li>Cycles pervade economic inequality. This has a tendency to
increase until the poor can't take it anymore and revolt. Or until the ruling
class realizes and course corrects. </li>
<li>Now irrelevant but quite prescient that they would apply Hegelian thinking to
industrialization. Meaning that industrialization is thesis, communism is
antithesis and now we need a synthesis. (Evidence points to Liberal welfare
states?)</li>
<li>Again the idea of compensation and balance in a great quote from Plato
"dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated fork of
tyranny and slavery out if the most extreme fork of liberty."</li>
<li>Monarchy - aristocracy - democracy - dictatorship (and so on). Cycle appears
over and over in history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Civilizations don't die completely. There are more readers of Homer today than
ever before.</p>

        <p>Each short story explores a novel premise that is vaguely science-fictiony. But
Le Guin's writings favor soft over hard sci-fi, rarely delving into Asimovesque
"gadgeting", mostly focusing on the romantic: emotions, relationships, feelings.
Some of my favorites from the book:</p>

<p>April in Paris: interesting fantasy/sci-fi exploration of the same place over
time. It gets a bit silly in the end, but very memorable. Her obsession with
archaeology is very apparent. </p>

<p>The Masters: the intersection between religion and technology is just always
fascinating. Reminded me a bit of one of my favorites: Canticle for Leibowitz</p>

<p>The Rule of Names: riffing on an interesting premise: nobody is allowed to
reveal your name to anyone. Pure fantasy with wizards.</p>

<p>Nine Lives: what happens when you grow up with/as a group of clones? What's it
like? How do you(s) interact with the world and others? What happens if your
group is split? Fascinating premise and great execution.</p>

<p>Some of her other stories are much less focused on a sci-fi premise, and more
focused on a mental trip and human psychology. She calls them psychomyths. </p>

<p>The Good Trip: close to my heart at the moment, as I worry about my life and
wife. I didn't realize Le Guin was from Portland. How cool!</p>

<p>A Trip to the Head: what if you lost your identity completely (terrifying), but
had the ability to pick one arbitrarily? Not particularly good, but reminded me
of some vague but unpleasant thoughts I had about VR.</p>

<p>I wonder if sf writers write with their future audience in mind. Like how would
their books read after we actually have become an interplanetary species?"</p>

    <title>Mindstorms by Seymour Papert</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I enjoyed this short book by the inventor of LOGO, which I fondly remember first
hearing about from Yuri as a kid. It was a challenging read, especially in the
philosophical sections in the end. Also I have this weird thing where Seymour
Papert and Mark Gross somehow blend into one person??</p>

<p>Papert is fascinated by embodied learning, and the LOGO Turtle is one of many
examples of an "object to think with". This has great benefits for children,
since they can imagine becoming a turtle in their mind. For example, drawing a
circle as a Turtle is simple: take a small step forward, turn to the right a
bit, rinse and repeat. This is easily translated into LOGO: <code>FORWARD 1; RIGHT
1;</code>.</p>

<p>Papert rails against the way math is presented in school, making compelling
arguments in its direction as well as the direction of "New Math", which I guess
was a big deal in 1980 but has not aged well. He draws a comparison from our
current educational system to QWERTY, which we have kept for a long time despite
its obsolescence. He warns about a dumb use of computers in the classroom, in
which computers program the child (e.g. Mavis beacon teaches typing). In
Papert's world, the child programs the computer and learns in the process.</p>

<p>Conceptually, LOGO represents a third view of geometry. Three views of geometry:
Euclidean is the most abstract, providing conceptual underpinnings. Cartesian,
which allows for algebraic descriptions and practical applications. And Turtle
which allows for an algorithmic approach. Latter is also more intuitively
approachable.</p>

<p>Today Papert's ideas live on in the maker movement, which Papert is generally
considered to have fathered (at least conceptually). I care about this movement
a lot. Also in my work as a software prototyper, I gravitate to "learning
through making", which is the lens through which I view my job.</p>

<p>Throughout the book Papert makes amazing analogies I haven't heard of before:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Analogy of artificial intelligence to artificial flight. We started by
imitating birds with flapping machines, but that clearly failed. Instead we
had to understand the principles (aerodynamics, bernoulli).</p></li>
<li><p>Analogy of samba school to education in general. Samba school is a naturally
integrated part of life in Brazil. It's informal, highly intense, sought
after. Great model for modern edu?</p></li>
<li><p>Analogy of teaching someone to juggle to programming computers. I haven't
really thought about this, but maybe this is why so many CS people juggle?</p></li>
<li><p>Analogy of the skiing revolution of the 70s to what is happening in computers.
One of many changes in skiing style that came about alongside a revolution in
ski technology. Did the new skiing technology cause the new style or vice
versa? Papert suggests a deep entanglement between the two.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>"The most powerful idea is that there are powerful ideas."</p>

        <p>He's way too simple in his breakdown. The two family views is ridiculous. It's
not fucking binary. People have much more granular and specific world views.
Cambridge analytics showed that very well with both Brexit and Trump.  Very
dated. Lots of 2000s era references that are no longer relevant, like
Schwarzenegger. Also a very political message, never giving conservatives a
steel man.</p>

<p>I forgot the book on a plane. But I won't be attempting it again despite its

    <title>The Futurological Congress by Stanislav Lem</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of Lem's work. I'm especially fond of Cyberiad, Star Diaries and
Solaris, but it has probably been over a decade since I've read one of his
books.</p>

<p>I wanted to get back into Lem, so I asked Marcin for recommendations, and he
suggested this one. My interest was piqued since I'm vaguely into rational
predictions, but as I read through, I was intrigued and surprised.</p>

<p>In the near future, the world has become politically unstable. A group of
futurologists meet at a summit in Costa Rica, and find themselves in the middle
of a military coup. To combat unrest, the government has begun experimenting
with air- and water-borne mind altering chemicals called Love Thy Neighbor
(LTN). As a result, most of the attendees of the congress suffer from
hallucinations and increased lovey-doveyness.  Lem's vivid descriptions of the
insanity inside the congress hotel are very entertaining.</p>

<p>In an attempt to remain rational and escape the vile chemistry, the main hero,
Lem's recurring character Ijon Tichy and a ragtag group of futurologists and
hotel workers end up in the basement below the hotel. For a while, Tichy fends
off the hallucinogens, but ultimately succumbs to them. The remainder of
the book (its majority) takes place in Ijon's disturbed imagination. This is
revealed only in retrospect, as Ijon wakes from each dream, finding himself in
the basement sewer, back in Costa Rica. Each of Tichy's hallucinations is a
different vision of a possible dystopian future, full of hilarity.</p>

<p>In his last and most convincing hallucination, Tichy is cryogenically frozen
only to be reanimated three decades later in a society that has completely
mastered mind-altering chemistry. Lem (and the translator, who did a fine job)
play incessantly with words, inventing at least fourty, all derived from
the idea of psychem, drugs that regulate every moment. The world is utopian,
but something isn't quite right. Tichy meets up with his (also reanimated)
futurologist friend, who gives him a whiff of "up'n'at'm, one of the
vigilanimides that can temporarily cancel out the effects of other psychem.
Tichy finally sees the world for what it is: a disturbing hellscape populated by
cyborg zombies.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the book is it clear whether you are in Tichy's hallucionation or in
actual reality. Clearly the book predates many of the many modern Sci Fi staples
that toy with the notion of reality, like the Matrix. Overall, it reads super
quickly and is incredibly engaging. Despite its humor, this book is quite deep.
It explores a lot of the same issues that concern me with VR. Chemistry is just
another of virtualizing reality.</p>

        <p>An entertaining short story in the newly formed genre of Jewish Science Fiction.
Very memorable characters: the conservative father, his liberal son.</p>

<p>The author (previously unknown to me) does a great job of capturing the essence
of Jewishness. The dialog is great, and the content is meaty. The theme of
constant repression regardless of circumstances comes up again and again.</p>

<p>The core issue is whether or not an alien race can be considered Jewish.
Hopefully this is an issue we can grapple with one day.</p>

<p>Loved the punch line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know. Let’s talk about something cheerful. How many people would you
  say were killed in that earthquake on Callisto?</p>

    <title>Superforecasters by Phil Tetlock</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Good vs bad experts is apparently thing. I wondered: was there enough data to
really know? What if everyone is a bad forecaster in aggregate? Luckily Tetlock
addresses it later.</p>

<p>How to superforecast:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider the outside view (eg. base rates)</li>
<li>Consider many perspectives on the same issue (eg. on one hand, on the other hand, on the third hand, on the nth hand).</li>
<li>Fermi problem style breakdown</li>
<li>Might benefit from explicit uncertainty tracking software. It's apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uncertainty_propagation_software">a
genre</a>.</li>
<li>I'm most interested in <a href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/scratchpad">guesstimate</a></li>
<li>Include opinions of others. They are valuable data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also interesting is the personality trait of being open to new experiences. And
curiosity in general.</p>

<p>Active open mindedness. Seek out dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Debaters is an instance of active open mindedness too - AOM</p>

<p>"Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded"</p>

<p>Interesting idea: adversarial collaboration. For example, Kahneman &amp; Klein, usually at odds with one another, still managed to publish an influential paper: http://www.fiddlemath.net/stuff/conditions-for-intuitive-expertise.pdf</p>

<p>Kahneman sneaking in: suggesting that supreforecasters are better at "internalizing" system 2 thinking via system 1.</p>

<p>Tetlock closes with a summary of the book in the form of ten commandments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Triage. Focus on questions where extra attention is likely to improve accuracy. Not too hard, not too easy. Weigh the consequences of wasting time on an unpredictable event vs failing to predict a predictable event before deciding whether to invest effort on a problem.</li>
<li>Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems ie use Fermi estimates.</li>
<li>Strike the right balance between the inside and outside views.</li>
<li>Strike the right balance between under- and over-reacting to new evidence.</li>
<li>Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. Weigh all the perspectives.</li>
<li>Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits, but no more ie get comfortable using fine-grained estimates for fine-grained problems.</li>
<li>Strike the right balance between under- and over-confidence, between prudence and decisiveness.</li>
<li>Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases. Own your failures!</li>
<li>Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you. Team dynamics matter as much as team composition.</li>
<li>Master the error-balancing bicycle. These commandments are not enough - you need deep, deliberative practice.</li>
<li>Don’t treat commandments as commandments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall a great book, but I'm left feeling a bit unsatisfied. Another random
thought: everything I've read this year is basically like "foxes &gt;&gt; hedgehogs".
But surely there must be some good arguments in defense of hedgehogs.</p>

    <title>Why Teach Thinking by Jonathan Baron</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I learned about J. Baron from reading Superforecasters, where he was cited in
the context of his notion of "active open mindedness". I got so excited that I
emailed him, and was very happy (<em>squee</em>) to receive a response within a day. My
favorite part of his response (I indicated that I was a Haidt fan):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have small disagreements with almost everyone, even myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First half: focus on systematic thinking mistakes people make. Two broad
categories: "myside" bias (very similar to confirmation bias) and over-reliance
on broken heuristics. Not really new but definitely insightful and quite early
(written in 1992).</p>

<p>Interesting studies cited:
- Thinking of reasons on the other side reduced inappropriate extreme confidence
in answers to objective questions (Koriat, Lichtenstein and Fischoff, 1980)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being provided with evidence against your point of view can make you more
convinced of your position (Batson, 1975).</p>

<ul>
<li>(eg. Striking example involving a group of girls who were convinced of the
divinity of Christ became more convinced as a result of the dead sea scrolls
which counter the virgin birth and resurrection.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Some people are convinced that one-sided thinking is actually better than two
sided thinking (Baron, 1989), even when the one-sided thinker favors the
position opposite of their own.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall interesting combination of prescience and datedness. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The impetus for teaching thinking in the USA comes from many desires: beating
  the Japanese in commerce; having demagogue-proof citizens; having more
  creativity in the popular arts; etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second half: much more focused on expert opinions, and how to evaluate them. A
lot more focus on education. Cites Piaget, etc. He sort of lost me and I didn't
really see how the first half related.</p>

<hr />

<p>Update (Dec 2016): After another exchange with Baron, I indicated that I wasn't
sold on the expert part of his essay. His response: I missed the point! Quoting
Jon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That last part is the important part. It argues that UNDERSTANDING AOT is just
  as important as being able to do it. We need to depend on others, so we need to
  know who we can trust. The basic idea was stated by J.S. Mill in "On Liberty":</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one
    property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on
    it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the
    case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it
    become so?  Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and
    conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said
    against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and
    upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Update (Jan 2017): I read a fragment of a book on thinking that he sent me. Two
chapters are relevant: the first, where he attempts to formalize what thinking
is as a process, and then the ninth, on actively open minded thinking.</p>

        <p>The best predictors are foxes, but even they do poorly. Interesting weakness:
foxes tend to be more swayed by scenario planning. Because they start vividly
believing all of the possible scenarios, so even unlikely ones become more
possible. Also interesting is that popular pundits tend to be hedgehogs because
they are prone to more extreme predictions that the audience likes.</p>

<p>Lots of good interesting failed predictions, just like I asked!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone have good recommendations for books/articles/lists on predictions from the past? Preferably failed ones :)</p>&mdash; Boris Smus (@borismus) <a href="https://twitter.com/borismus/status/785968518562852864">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Prediction is fundamentally hard because of chaos.</p>

<p>Good predictors:
- Peter Schiff predicting housing crash and recession.
- Ross Anderson predicting y2k mildness.
- Alan Barnes, pioneering work around predictions for Canada.
- James Fallows, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/01/how-america-can-rise-again/307839/">essay</a></p>

<p>Bad predictors:
- David Brooks predicting nonsense.

- F. E. Smith, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711931-the-world-in-2030-a-d">The World in 2030</a>
- Arthur Clark: profiles of the future 1962</p>

<p>Idea: correlation between difficulty of times and likelihood to turn to
superstition and religion. I should keep that in mind in the future. <a href="http://smus.com/hot-bread-delicious-deadly/">Russian
superstition</a> and magical thinking
is not caused by leading a happy life. I should be kinder to those afflicted.</p>

<p>Interesting conclusion: accurate predictions aren't necessary for good choices.
The goal is to make choices that are good in any event. If needed, skew
according to probability.</p>

<p>How to predict better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be fox like: aggregate different sources.</li>
<li>Meta cognition: consider how you arrive at your decisions. Know the biases.
But to avoid falling into them is hard! Exercise: enumerate reasons why
you might be wrong.</li>
<li>Be humble. Predictions are always uncertain. Predictions too far into the
future even more so.</li>

        <p>I read Godel Escher Bach many years ago and really enjoyed it at the time. When
I got my hands on this book, I was excited to read a late Doug Hofstadter work.
To my surprise, by the end of Chapter 3, I was done with it. This book had none
of the variety of its predecessor, and not much in terms of new ideas (as far as
I can remember). I competely agreed with a goodreads review of it, courtesy of
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/148256192?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1">Zach</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Conceptually, I guess you could say, I enjoyed it, but the presentation -
the language of the author, the over-long format, and the strange mixture of
hard math and elementary philosophy - diminished and diluted the content to
the point that it was barely worth reading. The first problem is
Hofstadter’s “aww shucks” Uncle Fluffy writing style. His language is so
steeped in a fireside chat mentality that the meat of his ideas is
completely devoured by his good-natured cleverness.

        <pre><code>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.
-- Archilochus
</code></pre>

<p>According to Isaiah Berlin, Tolstoy is a natural fox who wanted to be a
hedgehog. IB suggests that Tolstoy was too broad minded to be able to fully
embrace a single doctrine, which could satisfactorily explain how the world works:</p>

<pre><code>Any comforting theory which attempted to collect, relate, 'synthesize'
reveal hidden substrata and concealed inner connections, which, though not
apparent to the naked eye, nevertheless guaranteed the unity of all
things... [Tolstoy] exploded without difficulty.
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time, Tolstoy wanted to be able to find some Einsteinian unified
theory of everything (TOE), but was too talented as a critic to be able to do
so.</p>

<pre><code>What oppressed Tolstoy most was his lack of positive convictions; and that
famous passage in Anna Karenina in which Levin's brother tells him that he-
Levin- has no positive beliefs.
</code></pre>

<p>This division within himself caused him great pain at the end of his life.</p>

<p>As you can see, the writing here is not flowery, but rather complex and requires
a high degree of attention. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I lacked given
the circumstances of moving to Seattle.</p>

<p>This short book / essay was supposedly intended as a joke (an elaborate one, at
90 pages). Part of the fun is classifying people into animals, for example,
here's IB's take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foxes: Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin,
Shakespeare, Balzac and Joyce</li>
<li>Hedgehogs: Dante, Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Neitzsche,
Ibsen and Proust</li>
</ul>

<p>My conclusion is that Foxes &gt; Hedgehogs. The world really is complex, and a
simple unified theory seems very unlikely. Also, I'll have to read more IB,
in less turbulent circumstances. And more Tolstoy!</p>

      <div>
        <p>Yuval Noah Harari presents an outside view of humanity, from the perspective of
a complete outsider, an alien with no particular interest in the human species.
This is fascinating.</p>

<p>The scope of the book is very broad and often high level, starting with physics
and chemistry 13.5 billion years ago at the dawn of the universe. Then, he turns
to biology, which begins 3.8 billion years ago on earth, and finally to history
and the cognitive revolution which starts about 70,000 years ago. Since then,
12,000 years ago, we had agriculture, which sped up the cognitive revolution.
More recently, 500 years ago, the scientific revolution really turned it up a
notch. The orders of magnitude of difference are appropriately humbling.</p>

<p>I liked the distinction between objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. The
latter meaning something that exists within the communication network linking
the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes
his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.</p>

<p>Also striking was Harari's disdain for the agricultural revolution. He claims
that it made most people worse off. The general point being that "history's
choices are not made for the benefit of humans".</p>

<p>Another major theme is the unification of humankind, which compounds
inter-subjective effects since societies grow bigger and bigger. Over time,
cultures coalesce and form bigger and more complex civilisations. Even though
today's civilizations seem to be clashing, they actually agree on many things,
for example money. "For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers, and prophets
have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may,
money is also the apogee of human tolerance."</p>

<p>On religion, Harari has insights as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains
    evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the
    riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the
    entire universe - and He's evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach
    for such a belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, interestingly, he considers most "isms" to be religions. And this leads to
interesting analyses. Harari delves deeply into humanism which he breaks down
into three kinds:</p>

<ol>
<li>Liberal humanism: that 'humanity' is a quality of individual humans, and that
the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct.</li>
<li>Socialist humanism: hold as sacred not the inner voice of each individual,
but the species Homo sapiens as a whole.</li>
<li>Evolutionary humanism: humankind is not something universal and eternal, but
rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter has a long connection to Nazism, but Harari suggests (and I agree)
that modern biology is really pushing us back into that vein.</p>

<p>On the scientific revolution, Harari echoes the rational sentiment of accepting
ignorance. As soon as you truly accept that you do not know, you leave the door
open to new insights.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has
    been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched
    the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the
    answers to their most important questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, very worth a read (or listen, as I did).</p>

    <title>How to Actually Change Your Mind by Big Yud</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/how-to-actually-change-your-mind-by-big-yud"/>
    
    <updated>2016-08-28T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>//smus.com/books/how-to-actually-change-your-mind-by-big-yud</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Technically the second book in a giant epic entitled "Rationality: From AI to
Zombies". The author is a well known rationalist and active member/founder of
lesswrong.org, Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), etc.</p>

<p>Essentially, this is a series of essays written and published as "The
sequences", around 2009. They are loosely related and cover a wide array of
topics, many of them highlighting irrational modes of thought. Much of the work
focuses on biases central to behavioral economics, focusing on Kahneman-style
results. But the author goes beyond that, and also introduces a lot of opinion
for how a rationalist should behave. At the same time, there is a tendency to be
incredibly nerdy, which is alternatingly endearing and borderline autistic. I
found myself asking the question: if one becomes a purely rational agent, isn't
a computer strictly better? On the path to rationality, what aspects of humanity
is worth preserving?</p>

<p>Here's some new stuff I learned. A fair amount of the book covers behavioral
economics concepts that I read about already in TF&amp;S.</p>

<h4>Litanies</h4>

<p>Aumann’s Agreement Theorem suggests that no two rationalists can agree to
disagree, given that they have the same information.</p>

<p>Litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin">Gendlin</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is true is already so.
  Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
  Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
  And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
  Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
  People can stand what is true,
  for they are already enduring it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski">Tarski</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the box contains a diamond,
  I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond;
  If the box does not contain a diamond,
  I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond;
  Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against black and white thinking</h4>

<p>Yudkowsky is especially effective in his attacks on binary thinking. For
example, on partisanship:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once
  you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side,
  and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side, otherwise it's
  like stabbing your soldiers in the back - providing aid and comfort to the
  enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides
  of an issue in their professional life as scientists can suddenly turn into
  slogan-chanting zombies when there's a Blue or Green position on an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the tendency and fallacy in binary thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a natural tendency to treat discussion as a form of combat, an
  extension of war, a sport; and in sports you only need to keep track of how
  many points have been scored by each team. There are only two sides, and
  every point scored against one side is a point in favor of the other.
  Everyone in the audience keeps a mental running count of how many points
  each speaker scores against the other. At the end of the debate, the speaker
  who has scored more points is, obviously, the winner; so everything that
  speaker says must be true, and everything the loser says must be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The horns effect - all negative qualities correlate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stalin also believed that 2 + 2 = 4. Yet if you defend any statement made by
  Stalin, even “2 + 2 = 4,” people will see only that you are agreeing with
  stalin and you must be on his side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a very nice summary of a better way of thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all arguments reduce to mere up or down. Lady Rationality carries a
    notebook, wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real belief vs. belief in belief:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus
    “wanting to write.” Mark Twain said: “A classic is something that everyone
    wants to have read and no one wants to read.” Criticizing yourself from a
    sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, so that you’ll be
    able to say afterward that your faith is not blind. This is not the same as
    wanting to investigate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Assume your interlocutor is good</h4>

<p>"To argue against an idea honestly, you should argue against the best arguments
of the strongest advocates". This, and the closely related concept of the
principle of charity aka Steelmanning (the opposite of strawmanning), which I
heard from a Sam Harris interview, sent me on a long reading tangent of
arguments <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2016/08/on-steelmanning-arguments-and-personally-customizing-them/">for</a> and <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/against-steelmanning/">against</a>. Insightful tidbit from that
last link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, seek to understand the actual viewpoints people you disagree with are
  actually advocating.  Second, seek out intelligent and well-informed
  advocates of viewpoints you disagree with. You don’t have to make up what
  your opponents believe! As it happens, you have many smart opponents!
  Third, whenever possible, try to switch conversations from a debate focus to
  a collaborative truth-seeking focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to Big Yud. Some wisdom on focusing on the argument, not on the person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Someone once said "Not all conservatives are stupid, but most stupid people
    are conservatives". If you cannot place yourself in a state of mind where
    this statement, true or false, seems completely irrelevant as a critique of
    conservatism, you are not ready to think rationally about politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A variation on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/">reasonable person principle</a> (harkens back to my time
at CMU).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that
    everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange,
    mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their
    surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being
    in. [...] Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with
    themselves as the villains.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Deciding which side to argue</h4>

<p>Great distinction between rationality and rationalization. Very related to
Haidt's position that beliefs are intuitive but their defence is rational. But
Haidt makes no distinction like this. Would love to hear his thoughts on it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rationality is not for winning debates, it is for deciding which side to
    join. If you’ve already decided which side to argue for, the work of
    rationality is done within you, whether well or poorly. But how can you,
    yourself, decide which side to argue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eliezer suggests enumerating the evidence: "Lady Rationality carries a notebook,
wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side". Here's how
to construct an honest ultrarational argument for a particular political
candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather all evidence about the different candidates</li>
<li>Make a checklist which you will use to decide which candidate is best</li>
<li>Process the checklist</li>
<li>Go to the winning candidate</li>
<li>Offer to become their campaign manager</li>
<li>Use the checklist as the campaign literature</li>
</ul>

<h4>The future is hard to predict</h4>

<p>Herd instinct in venture capitalism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The majority of venture capitalists at any given time are all chasing the
    same Revolutionary Innovation, and it’s the Revolutionary Innovation that
    IPO’d six months ago. This is an especially crushing observation in venture
    capital, because there’s a direct economic motive to not follow the herd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what to do about it. DFJ (a VC) has a rule <a href="http://www.signallake.com/innovation/CrazyIdeasSuccessfulVC101009.pdf">favoring a passionate
minority</a> to outweigh a negative majority.  This also reminds me of the
<a href="https://www.quora.com/World-War-Z-2013-movie-Do-the-Israelis-really-have-a-10th-man-doctrine">Tenth Man Rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only two partners need to agree in order to fund any startup up to $1.5
    million. And if all the partners agree that something sounds like a good
    idea, they won’t do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Movies and books have a huge effect on the human psyche. This will probably
compound with more immersive storytelling mediums:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So far as I can tell, few movie viewers act as if they have directly
    observed Earth’s future. [...] But those who commit the fallacy seem to act
    as if they had seen the movie events occurring on some other planet; not
    Earth, but somewhere similar to Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Predicting numbers is especially difficult:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I observe that many futuristic predictions are, likewise, best considered as
    attitude expressions. Take the question, “How long will it be until we have
    human-level AI?” The responses I’ve seen to this are all over the map.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Avoid having THE Great Idea and get granular and specific</h4>

<p>Avoiding partisanship by focusing on the minimum viable argument, reminds me of
Sunstein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_minimalism">Judicial minimalism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly
    avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in
    school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it
    explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be
    Republicans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Avoid overly large uhh Thingies, and chop them up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cut up your Great Thingy into smaller independent ideas and treat them as
    independent. For instance, a marxist would cut up Marx's Great Thingy into
    theories of 1) value of labor 2) political relations between classes 3)
    wages 4) the ultimate political state of mankind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Other interesting stuff</h4>

<p>Taber and Lodge's <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x/abstract">"Motivated skepticism in the evaluation of political
beliefs"</a> describes six predictions which are very Haidt-y. It's a list
of political thinkos that are driven by behavioral economic biases.</p>

<p>Beliefs don't need to be completely bullet proof. But this contradicts
science, where a single counter example can topple a theory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as
    the hits don’t keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in
    the court of public opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a
    false theory no successes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the uselessness of "Deep Wisdom":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say,
    “Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud,
    you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep
    Wisdom. There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A
    fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the
    same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a distinction between Traditional rationalism and Bayesian rationalism.
And I worry that the Bayesian variety, which Eliezer is a subscriber of, is a
sort of hedgehogginess: a very focused and blindered approach. But I liked the
idea that you can go beyond falsification, the ability to relinquish an initial
opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on
    thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t
    yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer
    time in which to act. Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a
    second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Make America Great Again":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key component of a zeitgeist is whether it locates its ideals in its
    future or its past. Nearly all cultures before the Enlightenment believed in
    a Fall from Grace – that things had once been perfect in the distant past,
    but then catastrophe had struck, and everything had slowly run downhill
    since then.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>I bought this book 10 years ago, and it just sat on my shelf ever since. Not
sure how I got into it in the first place, but my interest in lucid dreaming has
increased as a result of my work on VR. As I delved into questions intimately
tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner
workings of our mind.</p>

<p>VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory
deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences
never possible in a sense-rich environment.</p>

<p>I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually
interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in
my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to
understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of
lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall. So, while I'm unlikely to become an
oneironaut, at the very least I've started a handwritten dream journal, which I
keep on my bedside table.</p>

people with differing opinions not to resort to personal attacks. Appeal to
reason hasn't always been the MO. It comes and goes and the author claims that
were in an especially reason free era.</p>

<p><em>How crazy PR is</em>: Nice case study looking into the political journalistic and
other heavy machinery that is used to sway people. Particularly at the first
Iraq war (about Kuwait), and swaying public opinion to the side of the US.
Especially fascinating is the "Naira" girl who cried wolf, who claimed to be a
Kuwaiti refugee suffering in Iraqi camps, but was actually a member of the
Kuwaiti royal family. Especially interesting is the chain of money and influence
and PR firms that takes that sort of inflammatory material and inject it into
peoples' minds.  Remember "Free Kuwait" t-shirts? Courtesy of Hill and Nolton, a
PR firm which was fed this information.</p>

<p>Astroturfing - creating fake grassroots movements that are actually sponsored by
some corporation</p>

<p>Logical follow up or supplement to The Century of the Self.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lebeau: the crowd is lacking reason, influenced by emotion, images.</li>
<li>Trotters: herd instinct, and group identity is key.</li>
<li>Lippmann: anti democratic conclusion that experts should run the show, not unwashed masses. regain critical faculties by understanding how PR works. also regulatory moves to make public deception illegal.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Soft vs. hard nudging</em>. fundamentally people don't always know what is best for
them, and government can step in. seatbelt laws force you to wear seat belts
always (hard paternalism). GPS navigation systems don't force you to take their
route, cigarette packs with graphic images: soft paternalism.</p>

<p><em>Shoving will backfire</em>: if people feel nudged, they nudge back. U.K. had a test
which gave job seekers a strength profile that was bogus. OIRA branch of the US
and sunstein. what does the most good and least harm? regulations like showing
calorie counts in fast food, environmental friendliness of consumer products,
hidden costs in air tickets and credit card fees. good defaults matter too.</p>

<p><em>Reason &gt; nudging</em>: reason based decisions will be more generally effective.
rather than appealing to some auto response, if you can reach the underlying
understanding, you're better off.</p>

<p>Some weaknesses: some parts, especially the ad related section, lists a lot of
studies, but not the strengths of the effect. Also, largely a derivative work,
mainly a summarization of other works: "Thinking Fast and Slow", "The Hidden
Persuaders", "Orality and Literacy".</p>

<p>Strongest part: chapter 5 about politics, etc.</p>

<p><em>Efficacy of arguments</em>: if dealing with people that agree already (eg. DNC to
Democrats), provide a one-sided argument. Otherwise, go both ways. Discrediting
the other POV is effective.</p>

    <title>The Righteous Mind by Jon Haidt</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I discovered The Righteous Mind via <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/evolving-minds">Jon Haidt's conversation with Sam
Harris</a>. I read it while on our Honeymoon, while Sarah was
enjoying another book about morality. It was very romantic! Anyway, some
thoughts on the book:</p>

<p>Haidt presents his argument in three parts. It's well structured, and super well
written:</p>

<ol>
<li>Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second (ie. people's morality is
driven by intuition/gut reactions, and then they are really good at
justifying their position through reasoning)</li>
<li>There's more to morality than harm and fairness (ie. conservatives care about
many other things: authority, loyalty, sanctity -- this is the foundation of
Moral Foundation Theory)</li>
<li>Morality binds and blinds (ie. arguments around group selection, social
cohesion and other benefits of religion and partisanship)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Not moral relativism</em>. In addition to borrowing from anthropology, Haidt
recounts a personal story of his visit to India, and how initial visceral
discomfort eventually transformed into some understanding of the cultural
context he found himself in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding the simple fact that morality differs around the world, and even
    within societies, is the first step toward understanding your righteous mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think that this is moral relativism, but moral descriptivism. Haidt does
not claim that morality <em>ought</em> to differ around the world, simply that it does
differ.</p>

<p><em>Nice analogies</em>: I found the analogy of a small rider (the rational) riding a
large elephant (the intuitive) apt and useful. Sort of like a lizard brain
idea. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The elephant is far more powerful than the rider, but it is not an absolute
    dictator.</p>
  
  <p>Under normal circumstances the rider takes its cue from the elephant, just
    as a lawyer takes instructions from a client. But if you force the two to
    sit around and chat for a few minutes, the elephant actually opens up to
    advice from the rider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Against rationalism</em>: Haidt presents an interesting argument against moral
rationalism. Firstly, he makes a compelling case for religion as something that
increases social capital via group selection, arguing against the New Atheist
view that religion is evil, period, with no redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>Haidt argues for the Humeian view of morality, and against Bentham's utilitarian
and Kant's deontological positions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Western societies became more educated, industrialized, rich, and
    democratic, the minds of its intellectuals changed. They became more
    analytic and less holistic.26 Utilitarianism and deontology became far more
    appealing to ethicists than Hume’s messy, pluralist, sentimentalist
    approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haidt finds support for Hume's position, which is that intuition (or sentiment)
comes first, and then reason tries really hard to come up with arguments to
support that position. Haidt's subjects were</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Morally dumbfounded — rendered speechless by their inability to explain
    verbally what they knew intuitively. These subjects were reasoning. They
    were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of
    truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>On changing minds</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with
    other people.</p>
  
  <p>If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the
    “other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying,
    and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. You may not agree,
    but you’ll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful
    and constructive yin-yang disagreement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He presents a framework for how this can happen:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0TIx3sN.png" alt="Social intuitionist model" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intuitions come first and reasoning is usually produced after a judgment is
    made, in order to influence other people. But as a discussion progresses, we
    sometimes change our intuitions and judgements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Against Rawls</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people,
    times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single
    moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges
    are variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Salient critiques of the left</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not
    consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you’re asking for
    trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It
    explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist
    revolutions usually end up in despotism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Conservative thinkers</em>, like Frederich Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Jerry Muller, and
Edmond Burke.  I ought to read them! Also, distinctions between conservatism and
orthodoxy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christians who look to the Bible as a guide for legislation, like Muslims
    who want to live under sharia, are examples of orthodoxy. They want their
    society to match an externally ordained moral order, so they advocate
    change, sometimes radical change.  This can put them at odds with true
    conservatives, who see radical change as dangerous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2016 is a very confusing year. The media appears to have completely lost its
ability to reason about or predict future political outcomes. Trump's
nomination, Brexit, the rise of populism all over the world, appears mysterious
and scary. In my left coast circles, the right is generally portrayed as
either rich and evil, or poor and dumb.</p>

<p>The Righteous Mind provides a more convincing explanation for contemporary
political divisions around differences in morality. Rather than just identifying
low intellect, sheepishness, or fascist tendencies with right leaning populists,
Haidt offers a useful framework for understanding the conservative world view.
This book is a must read for any political observer with any hope for
understanding.</p>

    <title>Must Mankind Repeat History's Great Mistakes</title>

        <p>Nice insight and guiding theme: international politics is complicated because
there isn't really an organization that stands above all nations. Unlike other
human endeavors, if a rogue entity misbehaves, there isn't really anyone to go
to by default. Each country has its own skin to worry about, and they need to
figure out the best strategy.</p>

<p>I liked the concept of the balance of power, presented in 3 versions by the
lecturer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simply the distribution of existing power.</li>
<li>The state in which all parties in question have equal power</li>
<li>A tendency for new power entering a conflict to join the weak side in order
to avoid a monopoly of power.</li>
</ol>

<p>After one or two theoretical lectures, the course ventured into territory of
WW1, the interwar years, and WW2. I found this part to be somewhat less engaging
since most of the historical details were review for me, and little of the
theory introduced at the beginning was brought into the fold. The last lecture
was more interesting, since it tried to apply the theory introduced at the
beginning to predict the future. What made it even more interesting is the fact
that the lecture was recorded in the early 90s.</p>

<p>The lecturer wasn't very engaging, and I found myself listening to a lot of the
lectures without getting much out of them. Additionally, the volume was low and
the recording was poor quality, which contributed to my meta objections.</p>

        <p>I really loved this one. It captures perfectly the quirkiness of Erdos, and his
mathematician circles. Much more than a biography, this book popularizes a lot
of incredibly interesting mathematics. It took me back 10 years to my math
undergrad days.</p>

<p>The author does an incredible job of capturing the essence of many complex
mathematical concepts in appealing and entertaining ways. It's instructive to
compare the way this book tackles certain topics to the corresponding Wikipedia
page, which is completely undecipherable by a non-mathematician, and often even
by a mathematician that doesn't work in that domain. That said, I'm  not sure
that this book would be as appreciated by someone without a background in math.
But it may serve as inspiration for a motivated, mathematically-inclined high
school student. I'll find out!</p>

<p>Despite having spent 4 years taking a bunch of math courses,  I learned a lot of
new math from this book, and was reminded by some favorites.</p>

<p>Ramsey Theory: the inevitability of order in large quantities. We barely touched
on Ramsey theory in 4th year Graph Theory, and it seemed really obscure. Not
true! Draw any 5 points on a plane, and as long as 3 of them don't form a line,
you are guaranteed to be able to form a convex quad using them as vertices. Take
any sequence of 101 numbers, and you're guaranteed to find a subsequence of at
least 10 increasing numbers.</p>

<p>Infinite series: a technical subject, but some really incredible results, like
Taylor expansions of e (sum of 1/k!), pi (6 times sum of 1/k^2).</p>

<p>Cantor's analysis of various infinities (alpha numbers): firstly the beautiful
argument about the countability of rational numbers, and then the famous
diagonalization argument which proves that the set of real numbers is a bigger
infinity.</p>

    <title>Mother of All Demos</title>

        <p>Took some notes from the famous <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/extra4/sloan/mousesite/1968Demo.html">Doug Englebart
demo</a>.</p>

<p>As a Human Computer Interaction nerd, I feel the need to pay homage to history
of the field. One glaring omission in my education is that I haven't fully
watched "The Demo" where Douglas Englebart shows off the state of the art of
"Man-Computer Interaction" circa 1968. The subject of the demo is NLS (Online
system), which is intended as a synthesis of a bunch of ideas coming from SRI.
It's quite impressive how far we've come, but also how many elements are still
recognizable, and in some cases impressively ahead of their time.</p>

<p>The first ten minutes introduce a series of key concepts that are staples of
desktop computing: the mouse and keyboard, mouse pointers, copy/paste, saving
and loading files, numbered lists. Less mainstream, VI-like features are also
introduced, such as reorderable, heirarchical lists, and folding sections.
Much of what goes on under the hood in NLS reminded me of VIM script and other
similar DSLs. Big focus on expert-oriented power usage.</p>

<p>The Demo heavily alludes to the web, with a lot of provisions for interlinking,
cross referencing, and even an explicit mention of ARPA close to the end of the
demo (Clip 33), which reminds the viewer that this is all pre-Intenet. In
contrast, their (presumably telephone-based) video calling was quite impressive.
The quality of the remote speaker seemed to be about as good (bad?) as
Englebart's. Some collaborative features were quite impressive, with a real-time
cursor sharing scheme which was decades ahead of its time. Others were less
interesting, like leaving a message for other people in a file to "get a
response within minutes".</p>

<p>Some time is spent showing off hardware. Most interestingly is the
<a href="http://dougengelbart.org/firsts/keyset.html">Keyset</a>, which was a 5-key
ancestor of the chorded keyboard, where each key combination (31 in total) led
to a character, and was intended as a one handed keyboard. Also interesting as a
point of comparison was the cutting edge display tech of the time: black and
white CRTs with 15 Hz refresh rates and super high (3 frame) persistence.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the lab behind MOAD was close to my heart, and lives on in R&amp;D
groups I've had the pleasure of being part of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build and try: big focus on prototyping!</li>
<li>Evolutionary: make incremental improvements to a real system, not grand visions.</li>
<li>Eat your own dogfood: use the thing you build, and test it on yourself.</li>
</ul>
