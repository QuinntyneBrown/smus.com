      <div>
        <p>I read <a href="http://int-des.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PsychofCuriosity.pdf">an academic paper on curiosity</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Loewenstein">George Loewenstein</a>.
It was surprisingly readable and very insightful.</p>

<p>Why did I read it? Just like <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/events/papert/">some</a> think about thinking, others
are curious about curiosity. More specifically, I recently read a <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/2/1/14392290/partisan-bias-dan-kahan-curiosity">Vox
article</a> that suggested "The more scientifically curious people are, the
more they are immune to the power of partisan thinking". What follows is mostly
a summary of the article, as well as some sketches I made to help me understand
it better.</p>

<p>Dark side of curiosity (it can be a vice):</p>

<ul>
<li>Stories of Pandora's Box, Eve's Garden, Lot's Wife's Pillar.</li>
<li>St. Augustine: "Ocular Lust"</li>
<li>Hume: love of knowledge vs. passion for gossip?</li>
<li>Exploratory non-sanctioned behaviors are often curiosity driven: drugs &amp; sex.</li>
</ul>

<p>Berlyne's types of curiosity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perceptual curiosity: drive for novel stimuli</li>
<li>Diversive curiosity: a more general stimulation seeking behavior linked to boredom</li>
<li>Specific curiosity: desire for a particular piece of information</li>
<li>Epistemic curiosity: a general human desire for knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>Unclear if perceptual &amp; diversive curiosity should be called curiosity, or
something else?</p>

<p>Trait vs. state curiosity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the distinction meaningful? (eg. Do you usually find the rooms you are in
to be too bright? vs. Is the room you are in too bright?)</li>
<li>No strong demographic correlates for trait curiosity.</li>
<li>State curiosity is way more interesting to study since "an improved
understanding of state curiosity, in contrast, has the potential to suggest
practical methods of stimulating curiosity in the broader population."</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/psychology-of-curiosity/intrinsic-vs-extrinsic.jpg" alt="Intrinsic vs. extrinsic curiosity." /></p>

<p>Curiosity and sex:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freud suggests that curiosity is a proxy for sexual curiosity, which is
suppressed by society.</li>
<li>In some rare cases, this is manifest as a general curiosity about the world.</li>
<li>But this theory is non-falsifiable (fuck yeah Popper / eat shit Freud).</li>
<li>Like sex, curiosity is an intense desire for information, but once attained,
is often disappointing (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-coital_tristesse">postcoitus triste</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Existing explanations for curiosity</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Curiosity as a drive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analogy to hunger and thirst: "appetite/thirst for knowledge", curiosity
can be satisfied.</li>
<li>It's per object (eg. satisfied curiosity about invertebrates), unlike food
where it's a general feeling of satiation.</li>
<li>Also unlike food, there's no "tissue need or deficit external to the
nervous system".</li>
<li>"Meta drive", since it's not the drive for the information directly, but
the drive for the desire to seek information (eg. an ape that opens the
window to see if there's something interesting there)</li>
<li>Also curiosity is easily disrupted by "tissue needs" like hunger and
thirst.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Incongruity theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Curiosity caused by violated expectations (Piaget, Hebb, Hunt)</li>
<li>Sweet spot / optimal level of incongruity. Too much incongruity =&gt; fear /
can't relate / can't incorporate new information.</li>
<li>Motivation: to resolve uncertainty. "Human nature abhors a lack of
predictability and the absense of meaning"</li>
<li>Also related to "Need for Cognition" which is more of a personality trait.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Competence motive: Curiosity may result from wanting to master one's
environment. This doesn't super compelling to Loewenstein (and me by
association).</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Situational causes for state curiosity</h1>

<p>Paradox: curiosity seeking behavior doesn't make sense if people are curiosity averse. </p>

<p>Sweet spot of expectation violation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too little expectation violation =&gt; bored.</li>
<li>Too much expectation violation  =&gt; overwhelmed. </li>
<li>So the in this model, the goal is to maximize the curiosity level.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/psychology-of-curiosity/expectation-violation.jpg" alt="Upside down U curve of ideal level of expected
violations." /></p>

<p>Conceptual controversy increases curiosity (experiment where students were put into groups intended to either foster conflict or consensus: 45% of controversy kids gave up recess to watch a film, vs. 18% in consensus group).</p>

<h1>Loewenstein's model: information gap</h1>

<p>Information gap: </p>

<ul>
<li>The gap between what you know (objective situation) and what you want to know
(the reference point).</li>
<li>Just like material wealth where it's hard to compare cars to swimming pools so
we use $, knowledge is multidimensional but can be reduced to 1D via bits
(info theory)</li>
<li>Also like material wealth, we rarely want to compare to unattainable (eg. the
rich and famous), but instead to your neighbor.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/psychology-of-curiosity/information-gap.jpg" alt="1D information gap" /></p>

<p>Quantifying the info gap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sensitivity to both relative and absolute magnitude of the info gap.</li>
<li>Gap between knowing 4 of 5 Pacific Ocean-bordering US states &gt; gap between
knowing 49 and 50 of US states.</li>
<li>Gap between knowing 40 of 50 US states &gt; gap between 4 of 5 Pacific Ocean
bordering states.</li>
<li>But some things affect curiosity that doesn't account in the info theoretic
view of the info gap (eg. facts that bring the plot to life in a murder
mystery.)</li>
<li>Precise measurement of the gap is often unnecessary, just a sense of whether
gap is increasing or decreasing. For research, can rely on self-reports.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Implications of the gap approach</h1>

<p>Subjects prefer more general rules to resolve uncertainty (study: 1. rule
generated list of 5 States vs. 2.  another rule that generated list of 10
states, subjects prefer to learn rule 2.)</p>

<p>More curiosity for insight vs. for incremental problems (study: 1. image-grid
where each cell was part of one animal vs. 2. each cell is its own animal,
subjects open more cells condition 1.)</p>

<p>Two ways of seeing a knowledge gap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Little knowledge =&gt; focus on what you know.</li>
<li>More knowledge =&gt; focus on what you don't know (ie. the information gap).</li>
<li>At some point in between, there's a discrete shift on focusing on ignorance
that makes you more curious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Paradox: if you don't know much, no real drive to learn more. Also, many people
don't know that they don't know a lot (Related to Dunning–Kruger effect.)</p>

<p><img src="/books/psychology-of-curiosity/curiosity-knowledge.jpg" alt="Curiosity increases with knowledge &amp; discrete shift." /></p>

<p>As a novice gains more knowledge the "unknown unknowns" become known unknowns,
which spurs curiosity. As you learn more, the gap closes and you become less
curious. Until there's a leap, your reference point changes realize your
ignorance again.</p>

<p><img src="/books/psychology-of-curiosity/curiosity-progression.jpg" alt="Alternating curiosity levels as your reference point
changes." /></p>

<p>A good way to cause awareness of the informational gap is via guessing and
feedback. It's difficult to deny the knowledge gap if you guess an answer
incorrectly. </p>

<p>Combination of guess and feedback increased curiosity (study: one group had to
first guess Easternmost, Northernmost, Southernmost states (w/ immediate
feedback) while the other didn't, and the one that did guess &amp; feedback was more
curious)</p>

<h1>Curiosity inducing stimuli</h1>

<p>Situations that increase curiosity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Direct question (eg. a puzzle or riddle)</li>
<li>A sequence of events with an unknown resolution, desire to complete a script
(eg. they went on a walk at night, suddenly they heard a noise). Q: "What
will happen?" / "Was I right?"</li>
<li>Violation of expectations. Q: "Weird, why did that happen?"</li>
<li>Possession of information by someone else (eg. someone chuckling as he reads
a news article). Q: "What does he know?" </li>
<li>Formerly known but forgotten things (eg. that word that was on the top of the
tongue...). Q: "What was that thing again!"</li>
</ol>

<h1>Conclusions / misc</h1>

<p>Loewenstein calls for more research on state (not trait) curiosity, and more
research on epistemic curiosity.</p>

<p>I should read William James' on scientific curiosity, since it's most relevant
for that Vox article, and also mentioned by Loewenstein as the type of curiosity
that mostly corresponds to specific epistemic curiosity.</p>

<p>I printed the paper, but the last page didn't come out. So I experienced the
recently learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect">Zeigarnik effect</a>: people remember uncompleted or
interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. I was very curious to see how the
paper ended, so had to finish reading the last page online.</p>

    <title>On Tyranny</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <updated>2017-06-13T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>http://smus.com/books/on-tyranny</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>More of a pamphlet than a book, both in brevity and in alarmist urgency. </p>

<p>Structured as a strange combination of trends that lead to tyranny and general
life tips. Dangerous trends include the destruction of institutions and
paramilitary rule. As for life tips, the author suggests reading more books and
longer articles, donating to charities, and having more conversations in person,
and remaining calm in the face of terror. </p>

<p>The last point I think is a good one and I agree that there is good reason to be
deeply concerned about the political impact of a major terror attack on US soil. </p>

<p>Overall quite heavy handed. Despite not calling out Trump by name, some passages
like this one are overly didactic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is patriotism? Let us begin with what patriotism is not. It is not
  patriotic to dodge the draft and to mock war heroes and their families. It is
  not patriotic to discriminate against active-duty members of the armed forces
  in one's companies or to campaign to keep disabled veterans away from one's
  property. It is not patriotic to ... (etc)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each "It is not patriotic" sentence refers to something deplorable Trump did in
the last 6 months. And it continues for a page and a half. A thought flashed
across my mind: how is this better than reading Twitter?</p>

<p>The author draws many false analogies to Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany.
He then normalizes extremist terror as just another thing by claiming that those
resisting fascists and communist regimes were also billed extremists (therefore
what?). He plays with words, uncharitably redefining a "nationalist" in contrast
to "patriot" as one "that encourages us to be the worst and the tells us we are
the best", whereas the two words are often used interchangeably.</p>

<p>The conclusion starts well written, with choice words criticizing "end of
history" narratives that helped get us here. But ends in conspiratorial hand
wringing.</p>

<p>In liberal cities like Seattle, the opposition is the majority and there are no
signs that things will flip any time soon. Most of Trump's policies are
signaling and most of them are counteracted with opposition signaling. He is an
awful leader for this country and I'm ashamed of his words and actions. But as
for actual policy changes or prosecution of specific people, he has (so far)
been stopped at every turn. I agree that these are unusual times, and that extra
vigilance cannot hurt, but hyperbole can be dangerous too. This book feels like
a classic case of crying wolf. I find it hard to believe that it will stand the
test of time. </p>

        <p>Incredibly vividly written. Fascinating to see the self made struggles of people
that are so fantastically well off.  Very unsympathetic characters throughout,
except for the narrator. </p>

<p>Something about Gatsby's lifestyle reminds me of my time in SF. Large house
parties, loose connections, endless networking and small talk.  There is a
certain aimlessness to it that I found very relatable.</p>

    <title>Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/finite-and-infinite-games-by-james-carse"/>
    
    <updated>2017-05-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>http://smus.com/books/finite-and-infinite-games-by-james-carse</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I was intrigued by the premise of the book, which introduces a theory of games
(emphatically not the game theory of economics), in which there are two kinds of
games: short, well defined finite ones where the goal is to win, and infinite,
rule-bendy ones where the goal is to keep playing. Great premise but I couldn't
get into it.  Despite being only ~100 small, sparse pages, I had to cut it off
after about twenty. Here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role
  of mother." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this profound or what? My impression is that the author is a deliberate
obscurantist. The whole book reads like a collection of Zen koans. But unlike
koans, which are simple on the surface but attempt conceal something profound,
the surface level is also very dense. The author casually cites Plato, Freud,
Hegel Marx, Jesus, Sartre, Thoreau, Shaw, Proust, etc. The book is full of
passages like the above that are meaningless without defining terms precisely.</p>

<p>Further, the author babbles a lot about theory, rarely producing actual examples
of infinite games. Presumably life is an infinite game, but are there other
examples? What good is a grand theoretical framework that only has one instance?
Lastly, given the author's definition, infinite games seem hardly game-like at
all.</p>

    <title>Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari"/>
    
    <updated>2017-05-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>http://smus.com/books/homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I decided to read Homo Deus because I enjoyed Harari's previous book, Sapiens.
The first 2/3 of Homo Deus is basically a rehash and more succinct version of
his previous book. Despite the repetition, I got a lot out of it, mainly because
I listened to Sapiens, so my retention was pretty bad. The last third of the
book was very speculative.</p>

<p>Interesting things from the recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2016, war killed 120k, crime 500k, suicide 800k, diabetes 1500k.</li>
<li>Well stated paradox of knowledge using Marx as an example. Specifically
communist revolutions never came to the western world because its leaders had
read Marx. </li>
<li>Also this logic conveniently defends Homo Deus existence as a way of avoiding
the future it describes. But also of obviating the author from any
responsibilities. Smart :)</li>
<li>Big claim that in 1016 Europe people knew what 1050 would be like (but not 2016,
2050). Not sure if this is just hindsight bias. </li>
<li>Nice crisp description of intersubjectivity, better than in sapiens. </li>
<li>Claim: religion is for control, science is for power. I agree, except
s/science/engineering/.</li>
<li>The Vatican was once an institution for technological progress, a Silicon Valley
type institution. Monasteries did contribute quite a bit to tech innovation,
even recently (e.g. Mendel)</li>
</ul>

<p>Even in the summary, Harari goes on some bizarre but interesting tangents:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several pages railing against lawns. They are purely status symbols and have
no practical value.</li>
<li>Snakes as ancestors. Dragons as wise creatures. Rainbow Serpents of Australian
Aborigines. Eve as a snake. Garden of eden as an anti animist fable.</li>
<li>The Garden of Woolsthorpe (where Newton's apple accident occurred) as a
founding Myth paralleling the garden of eden. This is where newton had his
kinematic revelation. Except rather than being punished for his curiosity like
Adam and Eve were, we have modern science. </li>
<li>Why do we have consciousness when there are so many automatic processes that are
handled by the body and the brain without any conscious intervention?</li>
<li>Weird and tenuous analogy of gods to corporations. Corporations actually
produce output like a product or service but gods are purely fictional. </li>
<li>Judge systems from without. For example a corporation thrives if it makes a lot
of money. But that's not why corporations exist. </li>
</ul>

<p>To transition from the summary to the meat of the book (speculating about the
future), Harari rehashes his branches of humanism:</p>

<ul>
<li>liberal: equality for all, economically artistically etc</li>
<li>social: socialism and communism. Deference to the group. </li>
<li>evolutionary: belief in superiority of some over others. </li>
</ul>

<p>My critique: this is too broad. Humanism seems to include everything that is
non-religious. Because either God is the main thing or humans are the main
thing. Are there other better alternatives? Maybe with Zen Buddhism? </p>

<p>Harari then dives into an overly stark analysis of the weakness of liberalism.
As if the only US allies were dictators during post war period. Not true! Most
of Europe was liberal. And although the Soviet Union was critical in defeating
Nazi Germany, liberal Allies did play a huge role too. Harari then goes into
counterfactuals, suggesting that social humanism (communism) defeated
evolutionary humanism (Nazism) in World War II, and that the Cold War didn't
turn Hot because of mutually assured destruction due to nukes. </p>

<h2>Last third</h2>

<p>The book really begins in Chapter 8, where Harari jumps headlong into future
speculation.  It's unclear to me why Harari jumps to some post humanist fantasy.
Currently we are seeing the resurgence of "evolutionary humanism" in the form of
authoritarian regimes. </p>

<p>Harari is clearly not an expert in AI and overly optimistic about it. He claims
that"computers programmed with ethical algorithms could far more easily conform
to the latest rulings of the international criminal court."</p>

<p>On replacing service type jobs, especially in medicine, over optimism. People
like dealing with people. And the supposedly empathetic machine is still a long
ways off. Even in the case of near perfect replication, I think acknowledging
consciousness and experience on the other side goes a long way. </p>

<p>More reductionist thinking: biology is just an algorithm and we can do
algorithms. Yes it is but the devil is in the details. </p>

<p>He cites a Frey and Osborne study which suggests that all sorts of jobs are
going away. A twenty year horizon cannot reasonably have such precise
probabilities. And many problems with specifics. 98% Sports referee jobs to go
obsolete by 2033? Sure we can tell fowls through video. Who will prevent fights?
Who will make difficult calls? Seems like bullshit. </p>

<p>On self knowledge again Harari goes too far by claiming that your self is the
sum of your biometric data. As long as we don't divulge everything to the
machine, aren't we quite far from this vision? I am surprised that a deep
meditator like the author believes this.</p>

<p>Harari lists several threats to liberalism posed by this hypothetical future
thing:</p>

<p>One threat is that we will lose our agency and become agents of some networked
machine. This is terrifying. We may need some anti-tech revolution to prevent
this. Also it's unclear what the scope would be. I'd like to always be able to
disconnect and go into nature. </p>

<p>Another threat is that the rich will become increasingly intelligent, healthy,
successful, further separating the gap between the rich and the poor.  I believe
that if things get bad enough, the population at large will rebel and
redistribute the spoils more evenly. </p>

<p>Here's why. In established first world countries, the rich know how to behave.
They rarely flaunt their money and mostly blend in with the rest of the world.
I think this is largely a self-preserving strategy. Many of those that don't
follow it aren't respected by giant swaths of the population. For example overly
flashy people are generally considered to be douchebags. Trump is an aberration
and widely hated. Now imagine if he was also some superhuman demigod. Would his
supporters be into that? If a tiny clique of people were visibly richer
healthier, people would rebel. </p>

<p>I think Harari a third point is only viable in an dystopian oligarchy. And if
people have become completely useless, why would some small elite group of
humans still hold the reigns? This scenario folds into the superintellihgence
one. </p>

<p>We use machine strength and machine intelligence augmented tools all the time.
Harari seems to be obsessed with the neural augmentation aspect, but is this
such a game changer?</p>

<p>Good points that are hard to argue against: human loss of smell, attention,
ability to dream. I seek to get it all back. But I wonder: were these all things
that came naturally to everybody in some long forgotten utopia, or did rare
individuals have to work on developing these skills for themselves while the
rest of the population plowed the field or caught the deer? </p>

<ul>
<li>Dreaming: It's no accident that Joseph's dream interpretation was so rare and
that there were commonly priest classes for interfacing with dreams</li>
<li>Smelling: yes seems likely that the masses of the day: hunters and farmers
needed this more long ago. </li>
<li>Attention: also an elite skill I think. We are In an age of distraction but
attention today is more needed than ever before. Attention for a hunter was
focused with adrenaline. Focusing otherwise is and probably was rare. </li>
</ul>

<p>The focus on technology changing our minds and wills seems premature. And by the
way this is why I think SSRIs are a slippery slope. Maybe the google normal
health index can serve as some humanistic baseline for human norms?</p>

<p>The last section is entirely focused on "Dataism". It sounds like he's
describing information theory. I suppose any discipline can already be viewed
through that lens. Except is that activity likely going to produce useful
results? Empirical evidence from science points to no. </p>

<p>Harari claims that the phrase "information wants to be free" means that
the information itself is the actor. This is surprising, since the phrase is not
meant to be taken literally, used as a slogan about increasing human access to
information. A cult of information worship for its own sake? I don't think this
makes sense without actual value to an actual human.</p>

<p>Harari has so far failed to explain who believes in dataism. Maybe some people
in SV appear to, but IoT usually has some actual purpose, like for example,
making things easier to use, or increasing productivity of a farm or factory.
If you lose the thread, you end up with tech for tech's sake (an existing
problem).</p>

<p>Also Harari's stance on the instagram sharing thing is really cynical. Yes
sharing with others is part of it. But many people have taken photos in the
past, for themselves and their friends.  It's clear to me that the value of
Human experience is inherent. Some people are overly addicted to external
validation, but this too is an existing problem.</p>

<p>Throughout the book Harari judiciously uses the word "may". This is good because
man the last third especially is just chock full of wild speculation.  It
strikes me that the way to read this book is as a provocation. Overall I'm left
with the feeling that this was a fast follow for Harari. A lot of the solid
stuff in the first 2/3 of the book is a rehash of Sapiens. The last part was
stimulating but mainly to get me thinking about why I disagree. </p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Overall an engaging lecturer and super interesting subject. Would have greatly
informed my trips to Japan. Most of these are quick notes about things that were
new to me:</p>

<p>Lots about Buddhism:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's a super interesting argument that the fact that Shinto traditions are
completely illogical is proof of the divine origin of those teachings. </li>
<li>There were multiple streams of Buddhism commonly practices in early Japan. Pure
Land Buddhism is very similar to Christianity's because of the centrality of
salvation through belief. Also there are multiple streams of Zen Buddhism. One
focuses on koans and the other focuses on meditation.</li>
<li>Key idea of zen gardens is that you get a new view from every step in the
path. This is a metaphor for human nature, which is prone to seeing the world
very differently depending on emotional state. Constant reminder about the
limitation of the senses. </li>
<li>In Pure Land Buddhism, gardens include a bridge to paradise. Dry landscaping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Politics:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Tycoon" comes from tai + kun, a made up title (great lord) for the Japanese
Emperor as a result of a Japanese-Korean treaty. It was invented to avoid direct
vassalage to the Ming. </li>
<li>Interesting oscillation between isolationism and globalism. 1600-1860 was
complete isolation. Hardly knew about the pre-WW2 Japan with Manchurian
ambitions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arts</p>

<ul>
<li>Apparently the tea ceremony inspired the English Arts and Crafts movement.
Also a part of minimalism. (Check out Okakuro's "The Book of Tea" from 1906). </li>
<li>(Check out Nou theater but it's unclear if I'll be able to follow it. Not much
interest in Kabuki.)</li>
<li>Haiku is young. Started in 1890. Fascinating idea of pivot words: homonyms that
can be used just once but translated into multiple of its meanings. Also renga
is an interesting chain of poems each written by another poet. </li>
<li>Hokusai invented the comic book. What. </li>
</ul>

<p>Lecturer provides a good summary of why he is interested in Japan: it's
incredibly interesting and exotic, but still has enough western services.</p>

    <title>The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant</title>

      <div>
        <p>This book attempts to distill authors' previously written and incredibly popular
multi-tome historical "The Story of Civilization" into under 100 pages. Full
disclaimer: I haven't read the original. I found this one is a bit of a mixed
bag. Overall, I say read it, since it's so short (~100 short pages).  I found
the flourishing writing style and strong opinions sometimes leads to funny dated
read. Similar in some ways to Jacob Bronowski writing. </p>

<p>Random but interesting ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freedom and equality are at odds. </li>
<li>Authors seem to rely on group selection. Still unclear what I think about the
idea. </li>
<li>Interesting coverage of the great man theory of history. A nod to both the
causes of greatness in the environment and also personal originality that can
bridge gaps.</li>
<li>Also insight into the yin yang nature of liberal vs conservative
thought. </li>
<li>Interesting that Rome took 500 years to collapse from its nadir in 60 BCE.</li>
<li>Revolutions rarely succeed in redistributing wealth, mainly in destroying it.</li>
<li>In Chapter X, authors express concern about a despot ruining America democracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of interesting thinking on morality and history:</p>

<ul>
<li>In general the idea that morality follows the times.</li>
<li>Intimate relationship between Bible and agriculture. Biblical morals developed
to help with agriculture, and have deteriorated as a result of industry. </li>
<li>Was every vice once a virtue? Pugnacity, brutality, greed, and sexual readiness
were virtues for the hunter age.</li>
<li>The idea that most times in history have been full of sin. Examples from the
Renaissance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things that felt dated and detracted from the experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>The chapters are mostly named "History and <em>_</em>". This obtuse naming gets old
quickly, and skimming the contents is completely useless.</li>
<li>The authors make predictions that geography no longer matters because
airplanes, completely ignoring reality of efficiency. They end pompously on
"man, not earth, makes civilization"</li>
<li>At some points the authors express fear that Catholics will take over US
politics. This is likely top of mind for the authors writing the book the
Kennedy era. I looked up the authors' religious affiliations and they come from
a Jewish background (squee!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The authors allude to some historical patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li>History that is written is different from history that is lived. </li>
<li>The church as an organization that stands above Christian nation states. Kind
of like a religious version of the UN. Like an alternative to the international
system. Except while the International System is really vague and doesn't really
seem to have much power, the Church worked once.</li>
<li>Prevalence of the cycle between religion and atheism. And I think that Sam
Harris is wrong about the end of faith. </li>
<li>Cycles pervade economic inequality. This has a tendency to
increase until the poor can't take it anymore and revolt. Or until the ruling
class realizes and course corrects. </li>
<li>Now irrelevant but quite prescient that they would apply Hegelian thinking to
industrialization. Meaning that industrialization is thesis, communism is
antithesis and now we need a synthesis. (Evidence points to Liberal welfare
states?)</li>
<li>Again the idea of compensation and balance in a great quote from Plato
"dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated fork of
tyranny and slavery out if the most extreme fork of liberty."</li>
<li>Monarchy - aristocracy - democracy - dictatorship (and so on). Cycle appears
over and over in history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Civilizations don't die completely. There are more readers of Homer today than
ever before.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Each short story explores a novel premise that is vaguely science-fictiony. But
Le Guin's writings favor soft over hard sci-fi, rarely delving into Asimovesque
"gadgeting", mostly focusing on the romantic: emotions, relationships, feelings.
Some of my favorites from the book:</p>

<p>April in Paris: interesting fantasy/sci-fi exploration of the same place over
time. It gets a bit silly in the end, but very memorable. Her obsession with
archaeology is very apparent. </p>

<p>The Masters: the intersection between religion and technology is just always
fascinating. Reminded me a bit of one of my favorites: Canticle for Leibowitz</p>

<p>The Rule of Names: riffing on an interesting premise: nobody is allowed to
reveal your name to anyone. Pure fantasy with wizards.</p>

<p>Nine Lives: what happens when you grow up with/as a group of clones? What's it
like? How do you(s) interact with the world and others? What happens if your
group is split? Fascinating premise and great execution.</p>

<p>Some of her other stories are much less focused on a sci-fi premise, and more
focused on a mental trip and human psychology. She calls them psychomyths. </p>

<p>The Good Trip: close to my heart at the moment, as I worry about my life and
wife. I didn't realize Le Guin was from Portland. How cool!</p>

<p>A Trip to the Head: what if you lost your identity completely (terrifying), but
had the ability to pick one arbitrarily? Not particularly good, but reminded me
of some vague but unpleasant thoughts I had about VR.</p>

<p>I wonder if sf writers write with their future audience in mind. Like how would
their books read after we actually have become an interplanetary species?"</p>

        <p>Several strategies for deeply working:
- Sabbatical for days
- Regular schedule e.g. Just mornings.
- Attempt to squeeze it in blocks of 90 minutes </p>

<p>Unconscious thought theory. Can you really solve hard problems unconsciously?
Does type 1 thinking have non primal uses?</p>

<p>Evenings are sacred. No work or work email. </p>

<p>General distractions like waiting in line and micro checking random stuff. How
to avoid it?</p>

<p>Roosevelt dashes: Deep work sessions: schedule in time blocks that are
completely distraction free: no email, social media etc.</p>

<p>Suggests not using social media at all. I like the idea but want to still read
articles from there. Probably get a twitter to rss thing?</p>

    <title>Mindstorms by Seymour Papert</title>

    <link href="/books/mindstorms-by-seymour-papert"/>
    
    <updated>2017-02-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I enjoyed this short book by the inventor of LOGO, which I fondly remember first
hearing about from Yuri as a kid. It was a challenging read, especially in the
philosophical sections in the end. Also I have this weird thing where Seymour
Papert and Mark Gross somehow blend into one person??</p>

<p>Papert is fascinated by embodied learning, and the LOGO Turtle is one of many
examples of an "object to think with". This has great benefits for children,
since they can imagine becoming a turtle in their mind. For example, drawing a
circle as a Turtle is simple: take a small step forward, turn to the right a
bit, rinse and repeat. This is easily translated into LOGO: <code>FORWARD 1; RIGHT
1;</code>.</p>

<p>Papert rails against the way math is presented in school, making compelling
arguments in its direction as well as the direction of "New Math", which I guess
was a big deal in 1980 but has not aged well. He draws a comparison from our
current educational system to QWERTY, which we have kept for a long time despite
its obsolescence. He warns about a dumb use of computers in the classroom, in
which computers program the child (e.g. Mavis beacon teaches typing). In
Papert's world, the child programs the computer and learns in the process.</p>

<p>Conceptually, LOGO represents a third view of geometry. Three views of geometry:
Euclidean is the most abstract, providing conceptual underpinnings. Cartesian,
which allows for algebraic descriptions and practical applications. And Turtle
which allows for an algorithmic approach. Latter is also more intuitively
approachable.</p>

<p>Today Papert's ideas live on in the maker movement, which Papert is generally
considered to have fathered (at least conceptually). I care about this movement
a lot. Also in my work as a software prototyper, I gravitate to "learning
through making", which is the lens through which I view my job.</p>

<p>Throughout the book Papert makes amazing analogies I haven't heard of before:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Analogy of artificial intelligence to artificial flight. We started by
imitating birds with flapping machines, but that clearly failed. Instead we
had to understand the principles (aerodynamics, bernoulli).</p></li>
<li><p>Analogy of samba school to education in general. Samba school is a naturally
integrated part of life in Brazil. It's informal, highly intense, sought
after. Great model for modern edu?</p></li>
<li><p>Analogy of teaching someone to juggle to programming computers. I haven't
really thought about this, but maybe this is why so many CS people juggle?</p></li>
<li><p>Analogy of the skiing revolution of the 70s to what is happening in computers.
One of many changes in skiing style that came about alongside a revolution in
ski technology. Did the new skiing technology cause the new style or vice
versa? Papert suggests a deep entanglement between the two.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>"The most powerful idea is that there are powerful ideas."</p>

        <p>He's way too simple in his breakdown. The two family views is ridiculous. It's
not fucking binary. People have much more granular and specific world views.
Cambridge analytics showed that very well with both Brexit and Trump.  Very
dated. Lots of 2000s era references that are no longer relevant, like
Schwarzenegger. Also a very political message, never giving conservatives a
steel man.</p>

<p>I forgot the book on a plane. But I won't be attempting it again despite its

    <title>The Futurological Congress by Stanislav Lem</title>

    <id>http://smus.com/books/the-futurological-congress-by-stanislav-lem</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of Lem's work. I'm especially fond of Cyberiad, Star Diaries and
Solaris, but it has probably been over a decade since I've read one of his
books.</p>

<p>I wanted to get back into Lem, so I asked Marcin for recommendations, and he
suggested this one. My interest was piqued since I'm vaguely into rational
predictions, but as I read through, I was intrigued and surprised.</p>

<p>In the near future, the world has become politically unstable. A group of
futurologists meet at a summit in Costa Rica, and find themselves in the middle
of a military coup. To combat unrest, the government has begun experimenting
with air- and water-borne mind altering chemicals called Love Thy Neighbor
(LTN). As a result, most of the attendees of the congress suffer from
hallucinations and increased lovey-doveyness.  Lem's vivid descriptions of the
insanity inside the congress hotel are very entertaining.</p>

<p>In an attempt to remain rational and escape the vile chemistry, the main hero,
Lem's recurring character Ijon Tichy and a ragtag group of futurologists and
hotel workers end up in the basement below the hotel. For a while, Tichy fends
off the hallucinogens, but ultimately succumbs to them. The remainder of
the book (its majority) takes place in Ijon's disturbed imagination. This is
revealed only in retrospect, as Ijon wakes from each dream, finding himself in
the basement sewer, back in Costa Rica. Each of Tichy's hallucinations is a
different vision of a possible dystopian future, full of hilarity.</p>

<p>In his last and most convincing hallucination, Tichy is cryogenically frozen
only to be reanimated three decades later in a society that has completely
mastered mind-altering chemistry. Lem (and the translator, who did a fine job)
play incessantly with words, inventing at least fourty, all derived from
the idea of psychem, drugs that regulate every moment. The world is utopian,
but something isn't quite right. Tichy meets up with his (also reanimated)
futurologist friend, who gives him a whiff of "up'n'at'm, one of the
vigilanimides that can temporarily cancel out the effects of other psychem.
Tichy finally sees the world for what it is: a disturbing hellscape populated by
cyborg zombies.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the book is it clear whether you are in Tichy's hallucionation or in
actual reality. Clearly the book predates many of the many modern Sci Fi staples
that toy with the notion of reality, like the Matrix. Overall, it reads super
quickly and is incredibly engaging. Despite its humor, this book is quite deep.
It explores a lot of the same issues that concern me with VR. Chemistry is just
another of virtualizing reality.</p>

        <p>An entertaining short story in the newly formed genre of Jewish Science Fiction.
Very memorable characters: the conservative father, his liberal son.</p>

<p>The author (previously unknown to me) does a great job of capturing the essence
of Jewishness. The dialog is great, and the content is meaty. The theme of
constant repression regardless of circumstances comes up again and again.</p>

<p>The core issue is whether or not an alien race can be considered Jewish.
Hopefully this is an issue we can grapple with one day.</p>

<p>Loved the punch line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know. Let’s talk about something cheerful. How many people would you
  say were killed in that earthquake on Callisto?</p>

    <title>Superforecasters by Phil Tetlock</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Good vs bad experts is apparently thing. I wondered: was there enough data to
really know? What if everyone is a bad forecaster in aggregate? Luckily Tetlock
addresses it later.</p>

<p>How to superforecast:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider the outside view (eg. base rates)</li>
<li>Consider many perspectives on the same issue (eg. on one hand, on the other hand, on the third hand, on the nth hand).</li>
<li>Fermi problem style breakdown</li>
<li>Might benefit from explicit uncertainty tracking software. It's apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uncertainty_propagation_software">a
genre</a>.</li>
<li>I'm most interested in <a href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/scratchpad">guesstimate</a></li>
<li>Include opinions of others. They are valuable data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also interesting is the personality trait of being open to new experiences. And
curiosity in general.</p>

<p>Active open mindedness. Seek out dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Debaters is an instance of active open mindedness too - AOM</p>

<p>"Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded"</p>

<p>Interesting idea: adversarial collaboration. For example, Kahneman &amp; Klein, usually at odds with one another, still managed to publish an influential paper: http://www.fiddlemath.net/stuff/conditions-for-intuitive-expertise.pdf</p>

<p>Kahneman sneaking in: suggesting that supreforecasters are better at "internalizing" system 2 thinking via system 1.</p>

<p>Tetlock closes with a summary of the book in the form of ten commandments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Triage. Focus on questions where extra attention is likely to improve accuracy. Not too hard, not too easy. Weigh the consequences of wasting time on an unpredictable event vs failing to predict a predictable event before deciding whether to invest effort on a problem.</li>
<li>Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems ie use Fermi estimates.</li>
<li>Strike the right balance between the inside and outside views.</li>
<li>Strike the right balance between under- and over-reacting to new evidence.</li>
<li>Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. Weigh all the perspectives.</li>
<li>Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits, but no more ie get comfortable using fine-grained estimates for fine-grained problems.</li>
<li>Strike the right balance between under- and over-confidence, between prudence and decisiveness.</li>
<li>Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases. Own your failures!</li>
<li>Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you. Team dynamics matter as much as team composition.</li>
<li>Master the error-balancing bicycle. These commandments are not enough - you need deep, deliberative practice.</li>
<li>Don’t treat commandments as commandments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall a great book, but I'm left feeling a bit unsatisfied. Another random
thought: everything I've read this year is basically like "foxes &gt;&gt; hedgehogs".
But surely there must be some good arguments in defense of hedgehogs.</p>

    <title>Why Teach Thinking by Jonathan Baron</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/why-teach-thinking-by-jonathan-baron"/>
    
    <updated>2016-12-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>http://smus.com/books/why-teach-thinking-by-jonathan-baron</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I learned about J. Baron from reading Superforecasters, where he was cited in
the context of his notion of "active open mindedness". I got so excited that I
emailed him, and was very happy (<em>squee</em>) to receive a response within a day. My
favorite part of his response (I indicated that I was a Haidt fan):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have small disagreements with almost everyone, even myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First half: focus on systematic thinking mistakes people make. Two broad
categories: "myside" bias (very similar to confirmation bias) and over-reliance
on broken heuristics. Not really new but definitely insightful and quite early
(written in 1992).</p>

<p>Interesting studies cited:
- Thinking of reasons on the other side reduced inappropriate extreme confidence
in answers to objective questions (Koriat, Lichtenstein and Fischoff, 1980)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being provided with evidence against your point of view can make you more
convinced of your position (Batson, 1975).</p>

<ul>
<li>(eg. Striking example involving a group of girls who were convinced of the
divinity of Christ became more convinced as a result of the dead sea scrolls
which counter the virgin birth and resurrection.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Some people are convinced that one-sided thinking is actually better than two
sided thinking (Baron, 1989), even when the one-sided thinker favors the
position opposite of their own.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall interesting combination of prescience and datedness. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The impetus for teaching thinking in the USA comes from many desires: beating
  the Japanese in commerce; having demagogue-proof citizens; having more
  creativity in the popular arts; etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second half: much more focused on expert opinions, and how to evaluate them. A
lot more focus on education. Cites Piaget, etc. He sort of lost me and I didn't
really see how the first half related.</p>

<hr />

<p>Update (Dec 2016): After another exchange with Baron, I indicated that I wasn't
sold on the expert part of his essay. His response: I missed the point! Quoting
Jon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That last part is the important part. It argues that UNDERSTANDING AOT is just
  as important as being able to do it. We need to depend on others, so we need to
  know who we can trust. The basic idea was stated by J.S. Mill in "On Liberty":</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one
    property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on
    it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the
    case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it
    become so?  Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and
    conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said
    against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and
    upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Update (Jan 2017): I read a fragment of a book on thinking that he sent me. Two
chapters are relevant: the first, where he attempts to formalize what thinking
is as a process, and then the ninth, on actively open minded thinking.</p>

        <p>The best predictors are foxes, but even they do poorly. Interesting weakness:
foxes tend to be more swayed by scenario planning. Because they start vividly
believing all of the possible scenarios, so even unlikely ones become more
possible. Also interesting is that popular pundits tend to be hedgehogs because
they are prone to more extreme predictions that the audience likes.</p>

<p>Lots of good interesting failed predictions, just like I asked!</p>

<p>Prediction is fundamentally hard because of chaos.</p>

<p>Good predictors:
- Peter Schiff predicting housing crash and recession.
- Ross Anderson predicting y2k mildness.
- Alan Barnes, pioneering work around predictions for Canada.
- James Fallows, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/01/how-america-can-rise-again/307839/">essay</a></p>

<p>Bad predictors:
- David Brooks predicting nonsense.
- Paul Erlich predicting ridiculousness in End of Affluence and Population Bomb
- F. E. Smith, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711931-the-world-in-2030-a-d">The World in 2030</a>
- Arthur Clark: profiles of the future 1962</p>

<p>Idea: correlation between difficulty of times and likelihood to turn to
superstition and religion. I should keep that in mind in the future. <a href="http://smus.com/hot-bread-delicious-deadly/">Russian
superstition</a> and magical thinking
is not caused by leading a happy life. I should be kinder to those afflicted.</p>

<p>Interesting conclusion: accurate predictions aren't necessary for good choices.
The goal is to make choices that are good in any event. If needed, skew
according to probability.</p>

<p>How to predict better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be fox like: aggregate different sources.</li>
<li>Meta cognition: consider how you arrive at your decisions. Know the biases.
But to avoid falling into them is hard! Exercise: enumerate reasons why
you might be wrong.</li>
<li>Be humble. Predictions are always uncertain. Predictions too far into the
future even more so.</li>

        <p>I read Godel Escher Bach many years ago and really enjoyed it at the time. When
I got my hands on this book, I was excited to read a late Doug Hofstadter work.
To my surprise, by the end of Chapter 3, I was done with it. This book had none
of the variety of its predecessor, and not much in terms of new ideas (as far as
I can remember). I competely agreed with a goodreads review of it, courtesy of
<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/148256192?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1">Zach</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Conceptually, I guess you could say, I enjoyed it, but the presentation -
the language of the author, the over-long format, and the strange mixture of
hard math and elementary philosophy - diminished and diluted the content to
the point that it was barely worth reading. The first problem is
Hofstadter’s “aww shucks” Uncle Fluffy writing style. His language is so
steeped in a fireside chat mentality that the meat of his ideas is
completely devoured by his good-natured cleverness.

    <title>The Hedgehog and the Fox</title>

        <pre><code>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.
-- Archilochus
</code></pre>

<p>According to Isaiah Berlin, Tolstoy is a natural fox who wanted to be a
hedgehog. IB suggests that Tolstoy was too broad minded to be able to fully
embrace a single doctrine, which could satisfactorily explain how the world works:</p>

<pre><code>Any comforting theory which attempted to collect, relate, 'synthesize'
reveal hidden substrata and concealed inner connections, which, though not
apparent to the naked eye, nevertheless guaranteed the unity of all
things... [Tolstoy] exploded without difficulty.
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time, Tolstoy wanted to be able to find some Einsteinian unified
theory of everything (TOE), but was too talented as a critic to be able to do
so.</p>

<pre><code>What oppressed Tolstoy most was his lack of positive convictions; and that
famous passage in Anna Karenina in which Levin's brother tells him that he-
Levin- has no positive beliefs.
</code></pre>

<p>This division within himself caused him great pain at the end of his life.</p>

<p>As you can see, the writing here is not flowery, but rather complex and requires
a high degree of attention. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I lacked given
the circumstances of moving to Seattle.</p>

<p>This short book / essay was supposedly intended as a joke (an elaborate one, at
90 pages). Part of the fun is classifying people into animals, for example,
here's IB's take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foxes: Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin,
Shakespeare, Balzac and Joyce</li>
<li>Hedgehogs: Dante, Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Neitzsche,
Ibsen and Proust</li>
</ul>

<p>My conclusion is that Foxes &gt; Hedgehogs. The world really is complex, and a
simple unified theory seems very unlikely. Also, I'll have to read more IB,
in less turbulent circumstances. And more Tolstoy!</p>

      <div>
        <p>Yuval Noah Harari presents an outside view of humanity, from the perspective of
a complete outsider, an alien with no particular interest in the human species.
This is fascinating.</p>

<p>The scope of the book is very broad and often high level, starting with physics
and chemistry 13.5 billion years ago at the dawn of the universe. Then, he turns
to biology, which begins 3.8 billion years ago on earth, and finally to history
and the cognitive revolution which starts about 70,000 years ago. Since then,
12,000 years ago, we had agriculture, which sped up the cognitive revolution.
More recently, 500 years ago, the scientific revolution really turned it up a
notch. The orders of magnitude of difference are appropriately humbling.</p>

<p>I liked the distinction between objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. The
latter meaning something that exists within the communication network linking
the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes
his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.</p>

<p>Also striking was Harari's disdain for the agricultural revolution. He claims
that it made most people worse off. The general point being that "history's
choices are not made for the benefit of humans".</p>

<p>Another major theme is the unification of humankind, which compounds
inter-subjective effects since societies grow bigger and bigger. Over time,
cultures coalesce and form bigger and more complex civilisations. Even though
today's civilizations seem to be clashing, they actually agree on many things,
for example money. "For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers, and prophets
have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may,
money is also the apogee of human tolerance."</p>

<p>On religion, Harari has insights as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains
    evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the
    riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the
    entire universe - and He's evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach
    for such a belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, interestingly, he considers most "isms" to be religions. And this leads to
interesting analyses. Harari delves deeply into humanism which he breaks down
into three kinds:</p>

<ol>
<li>Liberal humanism: that 'humanity' is a quality of individual humans, and that
the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct.</li>
<li>Socialist humanism: hold as sacred not the inner voice of each individual,
but the species Homo sapiens as a whole.</li>
<li>Evolutionary humanism: humankind is not something universal and eternal, but
rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter has a long connection to Nazism, but Harari suggests (and I agree)
that modern biology is really pushing us back into that vein.</p>

<p>On the scientific revolution, Harari echoes the rational sentiment of accepting
ignorance. As soon as you truly accept that you do not know, you leave the door
open to new insights.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has
    been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched
    the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the
    answers to their most important questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, very worth a read (or listen, as I did).</p>

    <title>How to Actually Change Your Mind by Big Yud</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/how-to-actually-change-your-mind-by-big-yud"/>
    
    <updated>2016-08-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>http://smus.com/books/how-to-actually-change-your-mind-by-big-yud</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Technically the second book in a giant epic entitled "Rationality: From AI to
Zombies". The author is a well known rationalist and active member/founder of
lesswrong.org, Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), etc.</p>

<p>Essentially, this is a series of essays written and published as "The
sequences", around 2009. They are loosely related and cover a wide array of
topics, many of them highlighting irrational modes of thought. Much of the work
focuses on biases central to behavioral economics, focusing on Kahneman-style
results. But the author goes beyond that, and also introduces a lot of opinion
for how a rationalist should behave. At the same time, there is a tendency to be
incredibly nerdy, which is alternatingly endearing and borderline autistic. I
found myself asking the question: if one becomes a purely rational agent, isn't
a computer strictly better? On the path to rationality, what aspects of humanity
is worth preserving?</p>

<p>Here's some new stuff I learned. A fair amount of the book covers behavioral
economics concepts that I read about already in TF&amp;S.</p>

<h4>Litanies</h4>

<p>Aumann’s Agreement Theorem suggests that no two rationalists can agree to
disagree, given that they have the same information.</p>

<p>Litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin">Gendlin</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is true is already so.
  Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
  Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
  And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
  Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
  People can stand what is true,
  for they are already enduring it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski">Tarski</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the box contains a diamond,
  I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond;
  If the box does not contain a diamond,
  I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond;
  Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against black and white thinking</h4>

<p>Yudkowsky is especially effective in his attacks on binary thinking. For
example, on partisanship:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once
  you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side,
  and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side, otherwise it's
  like stabbing your soldiers in the back - providing aid and comfort to the
  enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides
  of an issue in their professional life as scientists can suddenly turn into
  slogan-chanting zombies when there's a Blue or Green position on an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the tendency and fallacy in binary thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a natural tendency to treat discussion as a form of combat, an
  extension of war, a sport; and in sports you only need to keep track of how
  many points have been scored by each team. There are only two sides, and
  every point scored against one side is a point in favor of the other.
  Everyone in the audience keeps a mental running count of how many points
  each speaker scores against the other. At the end of the debate, the speaker
  who has scored more points is, obviously, the winner; so everything that
  speaker says must be true, and everything the loser says must be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The horns effect - all negative qualities correlate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stalin also believed that 2 + 2 = 4. Yet if you defend any statement made by
  Stalin, even “2 + 2 = 4,” people will see only that you are agreeing with
  stalin and you must be on his side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a very nice summary of a better way of thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all arguments reduce to mere up or down. Lady Rationality carries a
    notebook, wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real belief vs. belief in belief:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus
    “wanting to write.” Mark Twain said: “A classic is something that everyone
    wants to have read and no one wants to read.” Criticizing yourself from a
    sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, so that you’ll be
    able to say afterward that your faith is not blind. This is not the same as
    wanting to investigate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Assume your interlocutor is good</h4>

<p>"To argue against an idea honestly, you should argue against the best arguments
of the strongest advocates". This, and the closely related concept of the
principle of charity aka Steelmanning (the opposite of strawmanning), which I
heard from a Sam Harris interview, sent me on a long reading tangent of
arguments <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2016/08/on-steelmanning-arguments-and-personally-customizing-them/">for</a> and <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/against-steelmanning/">against</a>. Insightful tidbit from that
last link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, seek to understand the actual viewpoints people you disagree with are
  actually advocating.  Second, seek out intelligent and well-informed
  advocates of viewpoints you disagree with. You don’t have to make up what
  your opponents believe! As it happens, you have many smart opponents!
  Third, whenever possible, try to switch conversations from a debate focus to
  a collaborative truth-seeking focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to Big Yud. Some wisdom on focusing on the argument, not on the person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Someone once said "Not all conservatives are stupid, but most stupid people
    are conservatives". If you cannot place yourself in a state of mind where
    this statement, true or false, seems completely irrelevant as a critique of
    conservatism, you are not ready to think rationally about politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A variation on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/">reasonable person principle</a> (harkens back to my time
at CMU).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that
    everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange,
    mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their
    surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being
    in. [...] Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with
    themselves as the villains.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Deciding which side to argue</h4>

<p>Great distinction between rationality and rationalization. Very related to
Haidt's position that beliefs are intuitive but their defence is rational. But
Haidt makes no distinction like this. Would love to hear his thoughts on it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rationality is not for winning debates, it is for deciding which side to
    join. If you’ve already decided which side to argue for, the work of
    rationality is done within you, whether well or poorly. But how can you,
    yourself, decide which side to argue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eliezer suggests enumerating the evidence: "Lady Rationality carries a notebook,
wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side". Here's how
to construct an honest ultrarational argument for a particular political
candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather all evidence about the different candidates</li>
<li>Make a checklist which you will use to decide which candidate is best</li>
<li>Process the checklist</li>
<li>Go to the winning candidate</li>
<li>Offer to become their campaign manager</li>
<li>Use the checklist as the campaign literature</li>
</ul>

<h4>The future is hard to predict</h4>

<p>Herd instinct in venture capitalism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The majority of venture capitalists at any given time are all chasing the
    same Revolutionary Innovation, and it’s the Revolutionary Innovation that
    IPO’d six months ago. This is an especially crushing observation in venture
    capital, because there’s a direct economic motive to not follow the herd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what to do about it. DFJ (a VC) has a rule <a href="http://www.signallake.com/innovation/CrazyIdeasSuccessfulVC101009.pdf">favoring a passionate
minority</a> to outweigh a negative majority.  This also reminds me of the
<a href="https://www.quora.com/World-War-Z-2013-movie-Do-the-Israelis-really-have-a-10th-man-doctrine">Tenth Man Rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only two partners need to agree in order to fund any startup up to $1.5
    million. And if all the partners agree that something sounds like a good
    idea, they won’t do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Movies and books have a huge effect on the human psyche. This will probably
compound with more immersive storytelling mediums:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So far as I can tell, few movie viewers act as if they have directly
    observed Earth’s future. [...] But those who commit the fallacy seem to act
    as if they had seen the movie events occurring on some other planet; not
    Earth, but somewhere similar to Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Predicting numbers is especially difficult:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I observe that many futuristic predictions are, likewise, best considered as
    attitude expressions. Take the question, “How long will it be until we have
    human-level AI?” The responses I’ve seen to this are all over the map.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Avoid having THE Great Idea and get granular and specific</h4>

<p>Avoiding partisanship by focusing on the minimum viable argument, reminds me of
Sunstein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_minimalism">Judicial minimalism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly
    avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in
    school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it
    explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be
    Republicans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Avoid overly large uhh Thingies, and chop them up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cut up your Great Thingy into smaller independent ideas and treat them as
    independent. For instance, a marxist would cut up Marx's Great Thingy into
    theories of 1) value of labor 2) political relations between classes 3)
    wages 4) the ultimate political state of mankind.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Other interesting stuff</h4>

<p>Taber and Lodge's <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x/abstract">"Motivated skepticism in the evaluation of political
beliefs"</a> describes six predictions which are very Haidt-y. It's a list
of political thinkos that are driven by behavioral economic biases.</p>

<p>Beliefs don't need to be completely bullet proof. But this contradicts
science, where a single counter example can topple a theory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as
    the hits don’t keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in
    the court of public opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a
    false theory no successes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the uselessness of "Deep Wisdom":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say,
    “Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud,
    you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep
    Wisdom. There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A
    fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the
    same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a distinction between Traditional rationalism and Bayesian rationalism.
And I worry that the Bayesian variety, which Eliezer is a subscriber of, is a
sort of hedgehogginess: a very focused and blindered approach. But I liked the
idea that you can go beyond falsification, the ability to relinquish an initial
opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on
    thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t
    yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer
    time in which to act. Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a
    second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Make America Great Again":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key component of a zeitgeist is whether it locates its ideals in its
    future or its past. Nearly all cultures before the Enlightenment believed in
    a Fall from Grace – that things had once been perfect in the distant past,
    but then catastrophe had struck, and everything had slowly run downhill
    since then.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>I bought this book 10 years ago, and it just sat on my shelf ever since. Not
sure how I got into it in the first place, but my interest in lucid dreaming has
increased as a result of my work on VR. As I delved into questions intimately
tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner
workings of our mind.</p>

<p>VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory
deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences
never possible in a sense-rich environment.</p>

<p>I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually
interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in
my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to
understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of
lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall. So, while I'm unlikely to become an
oneironaut, at the very least I've started a handwritten dream journal, which I
keep on my bedside table.</p>

        <p>Rationality used to pervade English scene. Now no appeal to reason is even
attempted.</p>

<p>Mostly arguments today are adversarial. In the past it was possible to have
people with differing opinions not to resort to personal attacks. Appeal to
reason hasn't always been the MO. It comes and goes and the author claims that
were in an especially reason free era.</p>

<p><em>How crazy PR is</em>: Nice case study looking into the political journalistic and
other heavy machinery that is used to sway people. Particularly at the first
Iraq war (about Kuwait), and swaying public opinion to the side of the US.
Especially fascinating is the "Naira" girl who cried wolf, who claimed to be a
Kuwaiti refugee suffering in Iraqi camps, but was actually a member of the
Kuwaiti royal family. Especially interesting is the chain of money and influence
and PR firms that takes that sort of inflammatory material and inject it into
peoples' minds.  Remember "Free Kuwait" t-shirts? Courtesy of Hill and Nolton, a
PR firm which was fed this information.</p>

<p>Astroturfing - creating fake grassroots movements that are actually sponsored by
some corporation</p>

<p>Logical follow up or supplement to The Century of the Self.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lebeau: the crowd is lacking reason, influenced by emotion, images.</li>
<li>Trotters: herd instinct, and group identity is key.</li>
<li>Lippmann: anti democratic conclusion that experts should run the show, not unwashed masses. regain critical faculties by understanding how PR works. also regulatory moves to make public deception illegal.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Soft vs. hard nudging</em>. fundamentally people don't always know what is best for
them, and government can step in. seatbelt laws force you to wear seat belts
always (hard paternalism). GPS navigation systems don't force you to take their
route, cigarette packs with graphic images: soft paternalism.</p>

<p><em>Shoving will backfire</em>: if people feel nudged, they nudge back. U.K. had a test
which gave job seekers a strength profile that was bogus. OIRA branch of the US
and sunstein. what does the most good and least harm? regulations like showing
calorie counts in fast food, environmental friendliness of consumer products,
hidden costs in air tickets and credit card fees. good defaults matter too.</p>

<p><em>Reason &gt; nudging</em>: reason based decisions will be more generally effective.
rather than appealing to some auto response, if you can reach the underlying
understanding, you're better off.</p>

<p>Some weaknesses: some parts, especially the ad related section, lists a lot of
studies, but not the strengths of the effect. Also, largely a derivative work,
mainly a summarization of other works: "Thinking Fast and Slow", "The Hidden
Persuaders", "Orality and Literacy".</p>

<p>Strongest part: chapter 5 about politics, etc.</p>

<p><em>Efficacy of arguments</em>: if dealing with people that agree already (eg. DNC to
Democrats), provide a one-sided argument. Otherwise, go both ways. Discrediting
the other POV is effective.</p>

    <title>The Righteous Mind by Jon Haidt</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="/books/the-righteous-mind-by-jon-haidt"/>
    
    <updated>2016-07-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>http://smus.com/books/the-righteous-mind-by-jon-haidt</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I discovered The Righteous Mind via <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/evolving-minds">Jon Haidt's conversation with Sam
Harris</a>. I read it while on our Honeymoon, while Sarah was
enjoying another book about morality. It was very romantic! Anyway, some
thoughts on the book:</p>

<p>Haidt presents his argument in three parts. It's well structured, and super well
written:</p>

<ol>
<li>Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second (ie. people's morality is
driven by intuition/gut reactions, and then they are really good at
justifying their position through reasoning)</li>
<li>There's more to morality than harm and fairness (ie. conservatives care about
many other things: authority, loyalty, sanctity -- this is the foundation of
Moral Foundation Theory)</li>
<li>Morality binds and blinds (ie. arguments around group selection, social
cohesion and other benefits of religion and partisanship)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Not moral relativism</em>. In addition to borrowing from anthropology, Haidt
recounts a personal story of his visit to India, and how initial visceral
discomfort eventually transformed into some understanding of the cultural
context he found himself in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding the simple fact that morality differs around the world, and even
    within societies, is the first step toward understanding your righteous mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think that this is moral relativism, but moral descriptivism. Haidt does
not claim that morality <em>ought</em> to differ around the world, simply that it does
differ.</p>

<p><em>Nice analogies</em>: I found the analogy of a small rider (the rational) riding a
large elephant (the intuitive) apt and useful. Sort of like a lizard brain
idea. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The elephant is far more powerful than the rider, but it is not an absolute
    dictator.</p>
  
  <p>Under normal circumstances the rider takes its cue from the elephant, just
    as a lawyer takes instructions from a client. But if you force the two to
    sit around and chat for a few minutes, the elephant actually opens up to
    advice from the rider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Against rationalism</em>: Haidt presents an interesting argument against moral
rationalism. Firstly, he makes a compelling case for religion as something that
increases social capital via group selection, arguing against the New Atheist
view that religion is evil, period, with no redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>Haidt argues for the Humeian view of morality, and against Bentham's utilitarian
and Kant's deontological positions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Western societies became more educated, industrialized, rich, and
    democratic, the minds of its intellectuals changed. They became more
    analytic and less holistic.26 Utilitarianism and deontology became far more
    appealing to ethicists than Hume’s messy, pluralist, sentimentalist
    approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haidt finds support for Hume's position, which is that intuition (or sentiment)
comes first, and then reason tries really hard to come up with arguments to
support that position. Haidt's subjects were</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Morally dumbfounded — rendered speechless by their inability to explain
    verbally what they knew intuitively. These subjects were reasoning. They
    were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of
    truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>On changing minds</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with
    other people.</p>
  
  <p>If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the
    “other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying,
    and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. You may not agree,
    but you’ll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful
    and constructive yin-yang disagreement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He presents a framework for how this can happen:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0TIx3sN.png" alt="Social intuitionist model" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intuitions come first and reasoning is usually produced after a judgment is
    made, in order to influence other people. But as a discussion progresses, we
    sometimes change our intuitions and judgements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Against Rawls</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people,
    times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single
    moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges
    are variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Salient critiques of the left</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not
    consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you’re asking for
    trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It
    explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist
    revolutions usually end up in despotism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Conservative thinkers</em>, like Frederich Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Jerry Muller, and
Edmond Burke.  I ought to read them! Also, distinctions between conservatism and
orthodoxy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christians who look to the Bible as a guide for legislation, like Muslims
    who want to live under sharia, are examples of orthodoxy. They want their
    society to match an externally ordained moral order, so they advocate
    change, sometimes radical change.  This can put them at odds with true
    conservatives, who see radical change as dangerous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2016 is a very confusing year. The media appears to have completely lost its
ability to reason about or predict future political outcomes. Trump's
nomination, Brexit, the rise of populism all over the world, appears mysterious
and scary. In my left coast circles, the right is generally portrayed as
either rich and evil, or poor and dumb.</p>

<p>The Righteous Mind provides a more convincing explanation for contemporary
political divisions around differences in morality. Rather than just identifying
low intellect, sheepishness, or fascist tendencies with right leaning populists,
Haidt offers a useful framework for understanding the conservative world view.
This book is a must read for any political observer with any hope for
understanding.</p>

    <title>Must Mankind Repeat History's Great Mistakes</title>

        <p>Nice insight and guiding theme: international politics is complicated because
there isn't really an organization that stands above all nations. Unlike other
human endeavors, if a rogue entity misbehaves, there isn't really anyone to go
to by default. Each country has its own skin to worry about, and they need to
figure out the best strategy.</p>

<p>I liked the concept of the balance of power, presented in 3 versions by the
lecturer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simply the distribution of existing power.</li>
<li>The state in which all parties in question have equal power</li>
<li>A tendency for new power entering a conflict to join the weak side in order
to avoid a monopoly of power.</li>
</ol>

<p>After one or two theoretical lectures, the course ventured into territory of
WW1, the interwar years, and WW2. I found this part to be somewhat less engaging
since most of the historical details were review for me, and little of the
theory introduced at the beginning was brought into the fold. The last lecture
was more interesting, since it tried to apply the theory introduced at the
beginning to predict the future. What made it even more interesting is the fact
that the lecture was recorded in the early 90s.</p>

<p>The lecturer wasn't very engaging, and I found myself listening to a lot of the
lectures without getting much out of them. Additionally, the volume was low and
the recording was poor quality, which contributed to my meta objections.</p>

        <p>I really loved this one. It captures perfectly the quirkiness of Erdos, and his
mathematician circles. Much more than a biography, this book popularizes a lot
of incredibly interesting mathematics. It took me back 10 years to my math
undergrad days.</p>

<p>The author does an incredible job of capturing the essence of many complex
mathematical concepts in appealing and entertaining ways. It's instructive to
compare the way this book tackles certain topics to the corresponding Wikipedia
page, which is completely undecipherable by a non-mathematician, and often even
by a mathematician that doesn't work in that domain. That said, I'm  not sure
that this book would be as appreciated by someone without a background in math.
But it may serve as inspiration for a motivated, mathematically-inclined high
school student. I'll find out!</p>

<p>Despite having spent 4 years taking a bunch of math courses,  I learned a lot of
new math from this book, and was reminded by some favorites.</p>

<p>Ramsey Theory: the inevitability of order in large quantities. We barely touched
on Ramsey theory in 4th year Graph Theory, and it seemed really obscure. Not
true! Draw any 5 points on a plane, and as long as 3 of them don't form a line,
you are guaranteed to be able to form a convex quad using them as vertices. Take
any sequence of 101 numbers, and you're guaranteed to find a subsequence of at
least 10 increasing numbers.</p>

<p>Infinite series: a technical subject, but some really incredible results, like
Taylor expansions of e (sum of 1/k!), pi (6 times sum of 1/k^2).</p>

<p>Cantor's analysis of various infinities (alpha numbers): firstly the beautiful
argument about the countability of rational numbers, and then the famous
diagonalization argument which proves that the set of real numbers is a bigger
infinity.</p>

    <title>Mother of All Demos</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Took some notes from the famous <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/extra4/sloan/mousesite/1968Demo.html">Doug Englebart
demo</a>.</p>

<p>As a Human Computer Interaction nerd, I feel the need to pay homage to history
of the field. One glaring omission in my education is that I haven't fully
watched "The Demo" where Douglas Englebart shows off the state of the art of
"Man-Computer Interaction" circa 1968. The subject of the demo is NLS (Online
system), which is intended as a synthesis of a bunch of ideas coming from SRI.
It's quite impressive how far we've come, but also how many elements are still
recognizable, and in some cases impressively ahead of their time.</p>

<p>The first ten minutes introduce a series of key concepts that are staples of
desktop computing: the mouse and keyboard, mouse pointers, copy/paste, saving
and loading files, numbered lists. Less mainstream, VI-like features are also
introduced, such as reorderable, heirarchical lists, and folding sections.
Much of what goes on under the hood in NLS reminded me of VIM script and other
similar DSLs. Big focus on expert-oriented power usage.</p>

<p>The Demo heavily alludes to the web, with a lot of provisions for interlinking,
cross referencing, and even an explicit mention of ARPA close to the end of the
demo (Clip 33), which reminds the viewer that this is all pre-Intenet. In
contrast, their (presumably telephone-based) video calling was quite impressive.
The quality of the remote speaker seemed to be about as good (bad?) as
Englebart's. Some collaborative features were quite impressive, with a real-time
cursor sharing scheme which was decades ahead of its time. Others were less
interesting, like leaving a message for other people in a file to "get a
response within minutes".</p>

<p>Some time is spent showing off hardware. Most interestingly is the
<a href="http://dougengelbart.org/firsts/keyset.html">Keyset</a>, which was a 5-key
ancestor of the chorded keyboard, where each key combination (31 in total) led
to a character, and was intended as a one handed keyboard. Also interesting as a
point of comparison was the cutting edge display tech of the time: black and
white CRTs with 15 Hz refresh rates and super high (3 frame) persistence.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the lab behind MOAD was close to my heart, and lives on in R&amp;D
groups I've had the pleasure of being part of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build and try: big focus on prototyping!</li>
<li>Evolutionary: make incremental improvements to a real system, not grand visions.</li>
<li>Eat your own dogfood: use the thing you build, and test it on yourself.</li>
</ul>

        <p>This little book was recommended to me by a ski instructor after a ski lesson at
Squaw.  The man was probably in his 70s, but skied incredibly well, and had a
lot of wisdom to pass on. He was tough, but nice, like a One Minute Manager.</p>

<p>More of a pamphlet than a book, One Minute Manager unfolds as a story about a
young man wanting to learn to be a good people manager. The story makes the
points more vivid, but at its core, there is an interesting and somewhat
surprising strategy outlined for being a good hands off manager. The approach
reminds me a little bit of Christian's management style. There are three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set goals and expectations with the employee, write them down succinctly and
have them ready for review. (This is similar to Google OKRs, and definitely
worthwhile).</li>
<li>Especially early on, look for behaviors that are praise-worthy, and give due
praise honestly and directly. (This seems like a great idea to try on
interns).</li>
<li>Reprimand unwanted behavior as it happens, but emphasize their worth as
people. (This seems quite hard to pull off without being a dick).</li>

    <title>Gantenbein by Max Frisch</title>

    <id>http://smus.com/books/gantenbein-by-max-frisch</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Gantenbein was recommended to me by a close friend, who said it made a really
big impact on him. It took me a long time to get through this book, and I often
struggled to follow the narrative. The author writes in a very experimental
style, alternating between three different men, all of which are in love with
Lila, a beautiful stage actress. Events that happen don't seem to have
chronology or causation. Sometimes they branch out into multiple futures, other
times you reset in another time, another place, and as another person.  The book
is a set of sketches around these people, more so than a coherent whole. Adding
to the complexity, the narrator himself seems to not be a single person, but
alternates between people. And this smoke and mirrors is explicit. The author
often writes "I imagine...", and the title is more accurately translated "Let's
assume my name is Gantenbein".</p>

<p>I found this book to be a piercing view into human nature. I could relate to
much of what the characters within it struggle with, which made reading it
difficult and slow. Gantenbein, one of the protagonists, decides to pretend to
be blind for his whole life, and builds a relationship with Lila. He wears dark
glasses, which conceal his lie from others. But he himself has to be careful not
to reveal his secret. He can see, but must pretend that he can't, and this leads
to painful allegory on good relationships.</p>

<p>This book was hard to read. I never got into a flow, and ended up reading very
unevenly, often wanting to set it down for a while. But some parts I really
loved, like when one of the characters attends his own funeral. And I was
surprised to, after finishing it, have a feeling that some coherence emerged by
the end. My understanding of this book would benefit from a re-reading, but I
know that this is unlikely to happen.</p>

        <p>An interesting follow up to what I remember from high school &amp; first year
physics. My guess is that the subject of the class is too basic for those with a
degree in physics, but this is something I should ask Alex! I really liked how
all of the topics flowed into each other. I found this to be somewhat surprising
given Einstein's failed struggle to find some unified theory of everything. This
is probably credit to the lecturer, who, in addition to being a great
instructor, also coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubit</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the class follows Arthur C. Clark's second law:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a
    little way past them into the impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lecturer, Benjamin Schumacher, is quite engaging, and starts by breaking
impossibility down in terms of logical, physical and statistical terms. He then
goes into thermodynamics, framing the first and second laws in terms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion#Classification">perpetual motion machines</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the various Demons that show up in this lecture. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon">Maxwell's
demon</a> can control a flap between two chambers to make sure that
eventually all of the molecules end up in one of the chambers (thus decreasing
entropy). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon">Laplace's demon</a> is able to, from knowing the current state
of the world, predict the future perfectly. Both of these thought experiments
are forays into the impossible that, when disproven, set the stage for the third
law of thermodynamics and chaos / quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The section on space-time was fascinating, and served as a good introduction to
space-time diagrams (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram">Minkowski diagrams</a>), which I really liked.
Although, one thing that was missing is the visual element. Although very
lightweight in mathematical treatment, there were clearly some materials that
supplemented the lectures, which would have made learning easier. The whole
discussion on faster-than-light travel, time travel, and quantum cloning was
tied together nicely through the lens of the impossible. By the way, space-time
diagrams seem to be the reason for this <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/25460/can-we-see-all-of-the-observable-universe">observable universe
thing</a>.</p>

<p>Which brings us to Quantum. I've been interested in being interested in the
topic for a while because it's so unintuitive and strange. Schumacher's
overview is good, but I'm obviously still very confused. He outlines basics of
Quantum Mechanics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wave-particle duality: light has both wave and particle like behaviors.</li>
<li>Uncertainty: position and momentum of a quantum particle cannot both be
known.</li>
<li>Tunneling: because of this uncertainty, quantum particles can tunnel through
what in newtonian mechanics are inpenetrable barriers.</li>
</ol>

<p>There seem to be some fundamental truths about symmetry as pertaining to
conservation laws. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem">Noether's theorem</a> seems remarkably deep but way
over my head, which states that every symmetry in physics has some associated
conservation law.</p>

<p>I was also somewhat lost in the information theory asides (the lecturer's
specialty is information theory). That information theory is a branch of physics
at all is mysterious to me. Probably worth learning more about, though, given my
information-related profession.</p>

        <p>Really great series of 60 lectures – that's 24 hours worth as an overview of
philosophers and their main points. I took very few sporadic notes, as the
majority of my listening was done while riding a bicycle. Here are some of my
favorite philosophers and their quotes:</p>

<p>Thomas Reid's principle of credulity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no proposition that is uttered in discourse would be believed, until it
    was examined and tried by reason … most men would be unable to find reasons
    for believing the thousandth part of what is told them. Such distrust and
    incredulity would deprive us of the greatest benefits of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120204195817/http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pom/pom_behaviourism_wittgenstein.htm">Wittgenstein's beetle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine, he says, that everyone has a small box in which they keep a beetle.
    However, no one is allowed to look in anyone else’s box, only in their own. Over
    time, people talk about what is in their boxes and the word “beetle” comes to
    stand for what is in everyone’s box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a>. This is a treasure trove to be revisited.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stoic mindset, especially this quote attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus">Epictetus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kant's Categorical Imperative, in a few formulations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that
    it should become a universal law without contradiction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in
    the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at
    the same time as an end.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim
    always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And closely related, Rawls' <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/">Original Position</a>, although the lecturer
<a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/great-ideas-of-philosophy-2nd-edition.html">Daniel N. Robinson</a> is surprisingly dismissive of his ideas.</p>

<p>Karl Popper's ideas around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsification</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Falsifiability or refutability of a statement, hypothesis, or theory is the
    inherent possibility that it can be proven false. A statement is called
    falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which
    negates the statement in question. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with
    nullify, meaning to invalidate or "show to be false".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The debate between realism and anti-realism: whether or not scientific theory
describes what the world is actually like, or if it just serves as a nice model.
A succinct summary of the two positions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Realists see scientific inquiry as discovery while anti-realists sees it as
    invention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clarence Irving Lewis and the idea of qualia, especially well illustrated in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument">"Mary's room"</a>, which produces an interesting anti-materialist argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective
    picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller

        <p>(...including writing books)</p>

<p>Let's be clear: this is a self help book. I somehow got suckered into reading it
because I liked one of his blog posts. There are very few interesting or
original things in the book, and the author comes off as brash and trying too hard
to be funny. That said, I liked some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Systems vs goals. Focusing on achievement leads to emptiness after the fact.
Instead focus on a system and process. </p></li>
<li><p>Simplifiers vs optimizers is an interesting dichotomy. Usually it's about
optimizers vs satisficers but in this case I can see myself as a simplifier. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't listen to friends and family feedback on business ideas. Listen to the market. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the rest of the book can be reduced to common sense: eat well, exercise
daily. Some of Scott's specific advice is really uninspired and downright
depressing. He insists that you should learn to play golf, learn a second
language, how to use proper English grammar, how to be outgoing, a good
conversationalist and a public speaker. He devotes a chapter of the book to
learning a special command voice in order to manipulate people better. Move
along!</p>

revealing an autistic inclination towards the personification of inanimate
objects.</p>

<p>This manifesto can easily be reduced to an illustrated one pager, but Marie
insists on treading over the same ground multiple times.</p>

<ol>
<li>Discard everything you don't need by determining if it sparks joy. Go by
category, starting with clothes, moving on to books and personal items.</li>
<li>Once you've donated garbage bags full of items, organize them so that
everything you own has a place. Stand everything including clothes
vertically.</li>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>In many ways a rehashing of many ideas in philosophy, I think Sam did a good job
of bringing some longstanding ideas and debates to the fore without requiring a
degree in philosophy. The section on religion can be skipped, since he rehashes
old theses from End of Faith (oh yeah, hobby horse!)</p>

<p>The overall thesis is that the well being of conscious entities is of supreme
importance, and that morality is all about optimizing that. Intuitively, I agree
that this is a good, pragmatic, and secular definition. I am less interested in the
philosophical debate around it, but I don't think Sam adequately addresses the
other side of the argument adequately. Debates between utilitarian ideas and
other branches of philosophy have been raging for centuries, and with all due
respect, I don't think Sam is the guy to put them to rest.</p>

<p>Despite well being's illusive nature, Sam draws a parallel to health, which is
also difficult to pin down precisely. While the analogy is illustrative, health
is easier to define, and has been done out of practical necessity with metrics
like QALYs. Though flawed, a QALY-like metric that includes all aspects of well
being seems out of reach in 2016.</p>

<p>With that said, Sam hedges heavily against this reality, and repeatedly says
that we may not know what the best collective course of action is, but that one
(or in fact many) must surely exist. These many local maxima are the peaks of
The Moral Landscape.</p>

        <p>Amazing.</p>

<p>A masterpiece in three parts. The setting is post apocalyptic earth after a
mutually assured nuclear destruction scenario occurred in the 20th century.</p>

<p>While most of humanity has undergone the simplification, a small order of
Christian monks is dedicated to preserving human civilization. Their patron
saint, St. Leibowitz, an engineer from before The Deluge. After a bomb shelter
with his blueprint is discovered by a primitive monk, a religious scandal
unfolds, reminiscent of what might have happened in the dark ages to Galileo.</p>

<p>Many centuries later the blueprint is finally understood by a scientist
frustrated by a lack of truly novel discoveries. And an engineer from the same
order builds it. It is a simple electrical generator which powersq a lamp.</p>

<p>Eventually humanity returns to its pre Deluge level of technology and surpasses
it, achieving the ability to travel to exoplanets. But political strife is once
again at an alarming level. And as earth nears nuclear annihilation again, the
order of leibowitz prepares to preserve the blueprints and other critical
documents and send them, along with a small order of monks, to another planet
for resettlement.</p>

<p>The characters are vividly painted, and the historical projection of the dark
ages onto a modern technological background is fascinating and masterfully
crafted. The book serves as a stark reminder that there is no natural
progression toward better  times, and just how fragile our current paradise is.</p>

<p>The threat of nuclear war may feel like a bygone but I'm quite concerned about
it still.</p>

        <p>Fascinating collection of essays. In "In praise of idleness", Russell in 1930
predicts that automation will reduce the working day drastically. If your quota
of 1000 buttons can be fulfilled in 1/10th the time, you should have a lot more
time for pursuing your hobbies. Unfortunately this never happened.</p>

<p>In one of the essays, he declares himself as a socialist while simultaneously
distancing from marx, and Russian communism. Essentially he lays groundwork for
social democracy. His views on socialism are very reasonable and still relevant
today.</p>

        <p>Humanity discovers an advanced civilization, which has become extinct, but has
left a mysterious Gateway in our solar system. Gateway is a small world which
houses many ships capable of taking adventurers on missions to undisclosed
locations. The controls are cryptic, but slowly residents of gateways gain a
better understanding of how they work. Gateway is controlled by a conspicuously
evil trans-national corporation, which pays prospectors to take dangerous trips
on these ships with the  in hopes of discovery. They pay out lucrative bonuses.</p>

<p>The protagonist, an unsympathetic, and cowardly Robinette (aka Bob), comes to
gateway to try to strike it rich. He struggles with his own fears of going on
missions, and falls in love with Klara. Their dysfunctional relationship, his
troubled childhood, and pathological fear is woven deeply into the structure of
the book. Chapters alternate between Bob's memories on Gateway and Bob the rich
ex-prospector getting therapy sessions from a sentient Robo-psychoanalyst on
Earth. Bob's last mission ends in disaster, as he is separated from his beloved
as their ships try to escape from a black hole. Bob returns the sole survivor,
gets an inordinate amount of money from the corporation, but remains forever
unhappy, missing Klara and suffering from immense guilt.</p>

<p>Overall I liked the book. It was well written and captivating, reminding in some
ways of Robert Heinlein, but maybe a bit more dystopian. There were many
familiar tropes such as a very inter-ratial cast with exotic combinations of
first and last names, like Dane Metchnikov. Bob's adventures with hot space
babes are also I think a hallmark of this style of science fiction. I also
enjoyed Pohl's excerpts of Gateway public announcements, mission reports and
classifieds littered throughout the book.</p>

        <p>I really enjoyed this one. Clearly a novel for kids, this book provides a nice
overview of philosophy. However it is also quite entertaining. Events center
around Sophie and her mysterious philosophy teacher. Initially I was
disappointed, since it read like a philosophy class given to the reader through
letters sent to Sophie, but as the plot thickened, the format changed to
socratic dialog.</p>

<p>After a somewhat dry start, it is revealed that in fact the author is himself a
fictional character writing a book to her daughter, which reveals a lot of the
strangeness that happens in Sophie's World. Towards the end, her world becomes
increasingly exciting and fantastical, with cameos from more and more strange
fictional characters including Nils and the wild geese. And then it unravels,
when Sophie's fictional philosophy teacher reveals to everyone in their world
that they are living inside a fiction book. This self-referential trick reminds of
Borges and Hofstadter.</p>

<p>I was quite impressed that the Gaardner was able to fit a full intro to
philosophy course into a relatively short book, and still make it entertaining.
It passed my bar with flying colors and I'm keen to give it to Ben. It can be
his high school philosophy class!</p>

        <p>A historical account of modern middle eastern history from a US lens. Covers the
period between the late Ottoman Empire and September 11th, 2001 and its
aftermath.</p>

<p>I found the course illuminating, with some clarity on various infighting
rivalries within the Muslim world. Also a recap of Israeli history through an
Arab lens was interesting to hear along with additional details on all of the
major wars and their historical impact. I really liked the late 20th century
lens on US presidents as well: fascinating to view it through the middle eastern
lens. </p>

<p>The lecturer is quite biased toward the Arab states, which is not a stance I am
used to. At the same time it is clear he tries to moderate himself to better
appeal to a wider liberal audience. The argument that Israel and American
imperialism is largely to blame for problems in the Middle East runs deeply
through the lecturers narrative. And I suppose that this stance is not so
controversial among liberals too!</p>

<p>Often citing nuances like the definition of Jihad, and underplaying ideological
opposition in favor of external factor mentality, the lecturer makes his bias
very clear in parts. The continuous emphasis on the Israeli occupation gets old
fast. But his stance is not so extreme that he denies that there are genuinely
endemic problems, such as bitter infighting, a general reluctance of the Arab
world to come to the aid of the Palestinian cause, and homegrown (i.e. Not
created by the us) terrorists like Osama bin Laden and organizations like Hamas,
though he never actually calls it a terrorist organization. </p>

<p>Anyway mixed feeling at the end, since too many of my thoughts were wasted on
decomposing the lecturers bias and not enough spent to process the actual
content. Also the speaking cadence made it quite hard to listen to. Ended up
going to 1.5x by the end, which I rarely do. </p>

        <p>Broznowski tries really hard to impress with his breadth of knowledge. He
constantly drops references to art, literature and philosophy to make his point.
It's as if he is using himself as an example of a scientist who is also well
versed in liberal art (there are dozens of us!!). I found most of the writing to
be very fluffy, deliberately convoluted, and kind of annoying. I had a hard time
finishing despite it being such a short read. I set the book down for a month,
and returned to it later (upon returning from vacation).</p>

<p>In the first part, Broznowski makes the argument that science isn't in and of
itself good or evil, but just a tool. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he
attributes not to the invention of the atomic bomb, but to the politicians that
chose to use it. Seems like a pretty basic argument, but also flawed and not
new. Not being well versed in the philosophy of Science, not in a good position
to judge it.</p>

<p>In the third and final essay, Broznowski considers science as a social
institution, and compares it to the rest of society. This part I thought was
interesting.  Science has many attractive, democratic properties that I agree
could really stand to be ported into other human domains.</p>

<p>Professors Martin Vetterli &amp; Paolo Prandoni give an in-depth introduction to
digital signals, filtering, etc. A caveat: I only went through the first 10 (out
of 18) days of lectures, and did only some of the homework assignments.</p>

<p>Initially spurred on by a broad interest in music, audio, and sensor processing,
this course served as a very solid theoretical foundation.  The course starts
off with a very dry, theoretical exploration into Hilbert spaces, which served
as an excellent reminder that I can still sort of understand and enjoy
mathematics. However my somewhat pathetic mathematical abilities were stretched
to their absolute limit by Vetterli's systematic barrage of theory, and I would
have surely given up on day 2 if not for some of those upper year linear algebra
classes (thanks UBC!).</p>

<p>The lecture's first focus is on <strong>how to understand signals</strong>. Still shaky on
some of the theory, the lecture delves deep into the theory of fourier analysis
and the formal definition of the discrete fourier analysis and various related
methods like the DTFT. The treatment of the subject is so dry, it's hard to
breathe. Until as if in a sudden rainstorm, the theoretical desert can breathe
again when finally they bring up examples of the STFT, which I have been using
for a while for various audio-related applications at work, without knowing what
it was called.</p>

<p>The next big subject is <strong>transforming signals</strong>, or signal processing.  Here,
the professors introduce LTIs formally, and derive the idea that an impulse
response fully characterizes an LTI. Next they dive into simple filters, FIRs
and IIRs, covering various types of averages, discussing filter stability and
other formal properties. They try to build some intuition about filters from a
frequency-domain perspective, which is very useful to me. Lastly, the subject of
ideal filters is explored, as well as why such filters cannot be implemented in
real life. </p>

<p>Finally, they discuss how to actually design filters using the z-transform,
whose derivation remains somewhat mysterious to me, which is unfortunately
normal for an engineering course. Prandoni gives a good interpretation for the
pole-zero plot, which is a really elegant way of looking at filters. The lecture
turns practical for a brief moment, when they reveal that implementations
already exist for non-ideal versions of many of these filters and explore a few
differences between Butterworth, Chebyshev and Elliptic low pass filters. They
also talk about FIRs, and I finally understand the jargon of 'taps', which I
just heard about at a lecture held at Noisebridge.</p>

<p>I still struggle to convert block diagrams into equations, but feel like I have
a much better sense of second order IIRs that ship with the Web Audio API.
Overall a mathematically challenging, but interesting class.  I really wish
there was a better way to build intuition for a lot of the theory, though.</p>

<p>Excellent overview of perception. I learned a ton from these lectures, and
really want to enumerate all of the illusions and experiments that the lecturer
cites which give insight into the way our senses work. Lots of in-depth material
about our visual system, how we percieve motion, the incredible variety of depth
cues, as well as after-images and color effects. Some senses, like audition,
were largely review for me, but others, like olfaction and taste were completely
new to me. Multi-modal perception gets especially interesting, the canonical
illusion being the McGurk effect, but there are many more.</p>

<p>This course is much more than just enumerated sensory illusions, though.  The
great thing about it is that Vishton spends a fair amount of time on the general
principles of operation of our brains, from fundamentals of neurons and synapses
to opponent-process theory, which explains a great deal of perception phenomena
across the senses. From a UX and VR perspective, the material in this course is
totally invaluable. </p>

        <p>Really interesting deep-dive into human hands from many different perspectives:
anatomical, evolutionary, functional and social. The book is packed with facts.
For example, I had no idea the carpal bones were so numerous and complex! Also,
it's nice to understand why human opposition differs from monkeys and the
Opposability Index. Lots of interesting insights into distribution of
handedness, including that certain species of monkeys are predominantly left
handed, which is surprising on several levels. Napier also goes a bit into
fingerprints, basic patterns, and mentioning some relation to worn-off finger
prints in people with Celiac. It was fun to cross-correlate what was written in
the book with my own hands.</p>

<p>Overall a thoroughly interesting account and I found good insights from an HCI
perspective. I did think that the second part on social and cultural aspects was
too brief and incomplete.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the eye, the hand is our main source of contact with the physical environment. The hand has advantages over the eye because it can observe the environment by means of touch, and having observed it, it can immediately proceed to do something about it. The hand has other great advantages over the eye. It can see around corners and it can see in the dark.</p>

VR, but even for that I got bored about half way through and had to force myself
to finish.</p>

<p>The library allegory felt too obvious, as if the author was just shoving the out
with the old, in with the new in your face.</p>

        <p>The message was good and clear, but the writing was tedious. Like Gladwell
books, this one could be compressed to a short pamphlet. I liked the distinction
between hedonism and eudaimonia, which was a very ancillary point in the book,
but still new to me. I also liked the blue marble finish. But the meat of the
book consists of an glorified enumeration of activities related to water.</p>
