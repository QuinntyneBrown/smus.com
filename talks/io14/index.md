[David Coz][david], [Christian Plagemann][christian] and I had the
honor of giving a talk at I/O a few weeks ago, introducing Cardboard, a
simple way to turn your smartphone into a VR headset. Watch the [video
here][video].

I'm especially excited about two cardboard-related things. Firstly, the
magnet-based button, which I worked on, was generally liked and deemed
clever! I'm hoping to write more about the technical details of this in
the future, but [this techcrunch summary][tc] was music to my ears,
thanks guys!

Secondly, we've released the [VR toolkit on github][github] for you to
experiment with. The whole thing will be fully open sourced soon, but
for the time being, a JAR file, javadoc, and a sample application are
provided on the [Cardboard developer site][dev].
