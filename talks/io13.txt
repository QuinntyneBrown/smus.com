[Rick Byers][rick] and I gave a talk at Google I/O last week called
"Point, Click, Tap, Touch - Building Multi-Device Web Interfaces". We
talked about design guidelines, interoperability between mouse and
touch, best practices for touch laptops, some details about Chrome's
touch implementation, best practices for performance, and finally the
future of touch on the web. The [video][] and [slides][] are now
available.
