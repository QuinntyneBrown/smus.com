PhotoVRSE: interlinked VR
=========================

- Finish photovrse first :)

In its purest form, the world wide web is a collection of interlinked
text. This works super well for the many rectangular screens we interact
with on a daily basis: laptops, smartphones and everything in-between.
I remain uninterested in a VR world in which the central focus are
virtual rectangular screens floating in space. And so a natural question
arises: what is the primitive for a VR web analogous to text? One
possible answer... the photosphere.

I'm working on PhotoVRSE, a WebVR app-demo which explores this notion
and takes it to a logical conclusion.

## Photospheres, skyboxes and skydomes

If you look closely enough, photospheres are ubiquitous in almost all 3D
content. Open any outdoor 3D environment and look up, whether it's a
skybox or a skydome, there's your all-encompassing texture!
