Why Teach Thinking by Jonathan Baron
===
posted: December 2016
rating: yes

I learned about J. Baron from reading Superforecasters, where he was cited in
the context of his notion of "active open mindedness". I got so excited that I
emailed him, and was very happy (*squee*) to receive a response within a day. My
favorite part of his response (I indicated that I was a Haidt fan):

> I have small disagreements with almost everyone, even myself.

First half: focus on systematic thinking mistakes people make. Two broad
categories: "myside" bias (very similar to confirmation bias) and over-reliance
on broken heuristics. Not really new but definitely insightful and quite early
(written in 1992).

Interesting studies cited:
- Thinking of reasons on the other side reduced inappropriate extreme confidence
in answers to objective questions (Koriat, Lichtenstein and Fischoff, 1980)

- Being provided with evidence against your point of view can make you more
convinced of your position (Batson, 1975).
  - (eg. Striking example involving a group of girls who were convinced of the
    divinity of Christ became more convinced as a result of the dead sea scrolls
    which counter the virgin birth and resurrection.)

- Some people are convinced that one-sided thinking is actually better than two
sided thinking (Baron, 1989), even when the one-sided thinker favors the
position opposite of their own.

Overall interesting combination of prescience and datedness. For example:

> The impetus for teaching thinking in the USA comes from many desires: beating
the Japanese in commerce; having demagogue-proof citizens; having more
creativity in the popular arts; etc.

Second half: much more focused on expert opinions, and how to evaluate them. A
lot more focus on education. Cites Piaget, etc. He sort of lost me and I didn't
really see how the first half related.

---

Update (Dec 2016): After another exchange with Baron, I indicated that I wasn't
sold on the expert part of his essay. His response: I missed the point! Quoting
Jon:

> That last part is the important part. It argues that UNDERSTANDING AOT is just
as important as being able to do it. We need to depend on others, so we need to
know who we can trust. The basic idea was stated by J.S. Mill in "On Liberty":

>> The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one
property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on
it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the
case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it
become so?  Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and
conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said
against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and
upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious.

---

Update (Jan 2017): I read a fragment of a book on thinking that he sent me. Two
chapters are relevant: the first, where he attempts to formalize what thinking
is as a process, and then the ninth, on actively open minded thinking.


Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao
===
posted: November 2016
rating: yes

Liked:

- Copious references to nerd culture: nerdy books (LOTR, Dune, Lovecraft,
  Asimov, Heinlein), video games, comic books, the 1980s.
- Magical realism aspects: The Mongoose, cartoonish villans (The Captain,
  Trujillo) and heroes (Beli, The Doctor).
- Harkening to 100 Years of Solitude in the hispanic family epic.
- Nonlinear time, with the story flashing generations back.
- Oscar's relatable innocence, goofy character, purity of spirit.
- Interesting autobiographical narrator.
- Unexpected turns. After a slow start, you are taken into a deep rabbit hole of
  an incredibly turbulent family story. Things get weirder and weirder and more
  and more depressing. Fuku!
- Also, a really interesting look into Dominican Republic, and the political
  turmoil it went through in the 20th century.
- Fun to try to decipher the Spanish only having a rudimentary knowledge of the
  language!
- Very distinct and conversational tone.

Disliked:

- A little too sappy and charicaturey. Oscar's self-loathing is comical, and
  it's hard to really empathize with the guy.



Future Babble

The best predictors are foxes, but even they do poorly. Interesting weakness:
foxes tend to be more swayed by scenario planning. Because they start vividly
believing all of the possible scenarios, so even unlikely ones become more
possible. Also interesting is that popular pundits tend to be hedgehogs because
they are prone to more extreme predictions that the audience likes.

Lots of good interesting failed predictions, just like I asked!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone have good recommendations for books/articles/lists on predictions from the past?

Prediction is fundamentally hard because of chaos.

Good predictors:
- Peter Schiff predicting housing crash and recession.
- Ross Anderson predicting y2k mildness.
- Alan Barnes, pioneering work around predictions for Canada.
- James Fallows, [essay](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/01/how-america-can-rise-again/307839/)

Bad predictors:
- David Brooks predicting nonsense.
- Paul Erlich predicting ridiculousness in End of Affluence and Population Bomb
- F. E. Smith, [The World in 2030](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711931-the-world-in-2030-a-d)
- Arthur Clark: profiles of the future 1962

Idea: correlation between difficulty of times and likelihood to turn to
superstition and religion. I should keep that in mind in the future. [Russian
superstition](http://smus.com/hot-bread-delicious-deadly/) and magical thinking
is not caused by leading a happy life. I should be kinder to those afflicted.

Interesting conclusion: accurate predictions aren't necessary for good choices.
The goal is to make choices that are good in any event. If needed, skew
according to probability.

How to predict better:

- Be fox like: aggregate different sources.
- Meta cognition: consider how you arrive at your decisions. Know the biases.
  But to avoid falling into them is hard! Exercise: enumerate reasons why
  you might be wrong.
- Be humble. Predictions are always uncertain. Predictions too far into the
  future even more so.



I Am A Strange Loop
===
posted: October 2016
rating: no

I read Godel Escher Bach many years ago and really enjoyed it at the time. When
I got my hands on this book, I was excited to read a late Doug Hofstadter work.
To my surprise, by the end of Chapter 3, I was done with it. This book had none
of the variety of its predecessor, and not much in terms of new ideas (as far as
I can remember). I competely agreed with a goodreads review of it, courtesy of
[Zach](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/148256192?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1).

    Conceptually, I guess you could say, I enjoyed it, but the presentation -
    the language of the author, the over-long format, and the strange mixture of
    hard math and elementary philosophy - diminished and diluted the content to
    the point that it was barely worth reading. The first problem is
    Hofstadter’s “aww shucks” Uncle Fluffy writing style. His language is so
    steeped in a fireside chat mentality that the meat of his ideas is
    completely devoured by his good-natured cleverness.

The Hedgehog and the Fox
===
posted: September 2016
rating: yes

    The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.
    -- Archilochus

According to Isaiah Berlin, Tolstoy is a natural fox who wanted to be a
hedgehog. IB suggests that Tolstoy was too broad minded to be able to fully
embrace a single doctrine, which could satisfactorily explain how the world works:

    Any comforting theory which attempted to collect, relate, 'synthesize'
    reveal hidden substrata and concealed inner connections, which, though not
    apparent to the naked eye, nevertheless guaranteed the unity of all
    things... [Tolstoy] exploded without difficulty.

At the same time, Tolstoy wanted to be able to find some Einsteinian unified
theory of everything (TOE), but was too talented as a critic to be able to do
so.

    What oppressed Tolstoy most was his lack of positive convictions; and that
    famous passage in Anna Karenina in which Levin's brother tells him that he-
    Levin- has no positive beliefs.

This division within himself caused him great pain at the end of his life.

As you can see, the writing here is not flowery, but rather complex and requires
a high degree of attention. Unfortunately, this is exactly what I lacked given
the circumstances of moving to Seattle.

This short book / essay was supposedly intended as a joke (an elaborate one, at
90 pages). Part of the fun is classifying people into animals, for example,
here's IB's take:

- Foxes: Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin,
  Shakespeare, Balzac and Joyce
- Hedgehogs: Dante, Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Neitzsche,
  Ibsen and Proust

My conclusion is that Foxes > Hedgehogs. The world really is complex, and a
simple unified theory seems very unlikely. Also, I'll have to read more IB,
in less turbulent circumstances. And more Tolstoy!


Sapiens (audio)
===
posted: September 2016
rating: yes

Yuval Noah Harari presents an outside view of humanity, from the perspective of
a complete outsider, an alien with no particular interest in the human species.
This is fascinating.

The scope of the book is very broad and often high level, starting with physics
and chemistry 13.5 billion years ago at the dawn of the universe. Then, he turns
to biology, which begins 3.8 billion years ago on earth, and finally to history
and the cognitive revolution which starts about 70,000 years ago. Since then,
12,000 years ago, we had agriculture, which sped up the cognitive revolution.
More recently, 500 years ago, the scientific revolution really turned it up a
notch. The orders of magnitude of difference are appropriately humbling.

I liked the distinction between objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. The
latter meaning something that exists within the communication network linking
the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes
his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.

Also striking was Harari's disdain for the agricultural revolution. He claims
that it made most people worse off. The general point being that "history's
choices are not made for the benefit of humans".

Another major theme is the unification of humankind, which compounds
inter-subjective effects since societies grow bigger and bigger. Over time,
cultures coalesce and form bigger and more complex civilisations. Even though
today's civilizations seem to be clashing, they actually agree on many things,
for example money. "For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers, and prophets
have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may,
money is also the apogee of human tolerance."

On religion, Harari has insights as well:

>   So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains
>   evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the
>   riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the
>   entire universe - and He's evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach
>   for such a belief.

Also, interestingly, he considers most "isms" to be religions. And this leads to
interesting analyses. Harari delves deeply into humanism which he breaks down
into three kinds:

1. Liberal humanism: that 'humanity' is a quality of individual humans, and that
   the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct.
2. Socialist humanism: hold as sacred not the inner voice of each individual,
   but the species Homo sapiens as a whole.
3. Evolutionary humanism: humankind is not something universal and eternal, but
   rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate.

The latter has a long connection to Nazism, but Harari suggests (and I agree)
that modern biology is really pushing us back into that vein.

On the scientific revolution, Harari echoes the rational sentiment of accepting
ignorance. As soon as you truly accept that you do not know, you leave the door
open to new insights.

>   The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has
>   been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched
>   the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the
>   answers to their most important questions.

Overall, very worth a read (or listen, as I did).

How to Actually Change Your Mind by Big Yud
===
posted: August 2016
rating: yes

Technically the second book in a giant epic entitled "Rationality: From AI to
Zombies". The author is a well known rationalist and active member/founder of
lesswrong.org, Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR), etc.

Essentially, this is a series of essays written and published as "The
sequences", around 2009. They are loosely related and cover a wide array of
topics, many of them highlighting irrational modes of thought. Much of the work
focuses on biases central to behavioral economics, focusing on Kahneman-style
results. But the author goes beyond that, and also introduces a lot of opinion
for how a rationalist should behave. At the same time, there is a tendency to be
incredibly nerdy, which is alternatingly endearing and borderline autistic. I
found myself asking the question: if one becomes a purely rational agent, isn't
a computer strictly better? On the path to rationality, what aspects of humanity
is worth preserving?

Here's some new stuff I learned. A fair amount of the book covers behavioral
economics concepts that I read about already in TF&S.

#### Litanies

Aumann’s Agreement Theorem suggests that no two rationalists can agree to
disagree, given that they have the same information.

Litany of [Gendlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin):

> What is true is already so.
> Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
> Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
> And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
> Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
> People can stand what is true,
> for they are already enduring it.

Litany of [Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski):

> If the box contains a diamond,
> I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond;
> If the box does not contain a diamond,
> I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond;
> Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.


#### Against black and white thinking

Yudkowsky is especially effective in his attacks on binary thinking. For
example, on partisanship:

> Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once
> you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side,
> and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side, otherwise it's
> like stabbing your soldiers in the back - providing aid and comfort to the
> enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides
> of an issue in their professional life as scientists can suddenly turn into
> slogan-chanting zombies when there's a Blue or Green position on an issue.

On the tendency and fallacy in binary thought:

> There is a natural tendency to treat discussion as a form of combat, an
> extension of war, a sport; and in sports you only need to keep track of how
> many points have been scored by each team. There are only two sides, and
> every point scored against one side is a point in favor of the other.
> Everyone in the audience keeps a mental running count of how many points
> each speaker scores against the other. At the end of the debate, the speaker
> who has scored more points is, obviously, the winner; so everything that
> speaker says must be true, and everything the loser says must be wrong.

The horns effect - all negative qualities correlate:

> Stalin also believed that 2 + 2 = 4. Yet if you defend any statement made by
> Stalin, even “2 + 2 = 4,” people will see only that you are agreeing with
> stalin and you must be on his side.

And a very nice summary of a better way of thinking:

>   Not all arguments reduce to mere up or down. Lady Rationality carries a
>   notebook, wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side.

Real belief vs. belief in belief:

>   Roger Zelazny once distinguished between “wanting to be an author” versus
>   “wanting to write.” Mark Twain said: “A classic is something that everyone
>   wants to have read and no one wants to read.” Criticizing yourself from a
>   sense of duty leaves you wanting to have investigated, so that you’ll be
>   able to say afterward that your faith is not blind. This is not the same as
>   wanting to investigate.

#### Assume your interlocutor is good

"To argue against an idea honestly, you should argue against the best arguments
of the strongest advocates". This, and the closely related concept of the
principle of charity aka Steelmanning (the opposite of strawmanning), which I
heard from a Sam Harris interview, sent me on a long reading tangent of
arguments [for][forsteel] and [against][antisteel]. Insightful tidbit from that
last link:

> First, seek to understand the actual viewpoints people you disagree with are
> actually advocating.  Second, seek out intelligent and well-informed
> advocates of viewpoints you disagree with. You don’t have to make up what
> your opponents believe! As it happens, you have many smart opponents!
> Third, whenever possible, try to switch conversations from a debate focus to
> a collaborative truth-seeking focus.

Back to Big Yud. Some wisdom on focusing on the argument, not on the person:

>   Someone once said "Not all conservatives are stupid, but most stupid people
>   are conservatives". If you cannot place yourself in a state of mind where
>   this statement, true or false, seems completely irrelevant as a critique of
>   conservatism, you are not ready to think rationally about politics.

A variation on the [reasonable person principle][rpp] (harkens back to my time
at CMU).

>   To understand why people act the way they do, we must first realize that
>   everyone sees themselves as behaving normally. Don’t ask what strange,
>   mutant disposition they were born with, which directly corresponds to their
>   surface behavior. Rather, ask what situations people see themselves as being
>   in. [...] Realistically, most people don’t construct their life stories with
>   themselves as the villains.

#### Deciding which side to argue

Great distinction between rationality and rationalization. Very related to
Haidt's position that beliefs are intuitive but their defence is rational. But
Haidt makes no distinction like this. Would love to hear his thoughts on it.

>   Rationality is not for winning debates, it is for deciding which side to
>   join. If you’ve already decided which side to argue for, the work of
>   rationality is done within you, whether well or poorly. But how can you,
>   yourself, decide which side to argue?

Eliezer suggests enumerating the evidence: "Lady Rationality carries a notebook,
wherein she writes down all the facts that aren’t on anyone’s side". Here's how
to construct an honest ultrarational argument for a particular political
candidate:

- Gather all evidence about the different candidates
- Make a checklist which you will use to decide which candidate is best
- Process the checklist
- Go to the winning candidate
- Offer to become their campaign manager
- Use the checklist as the campaign literature


#### The future is hard to predict

Herd instinct in venture capitalism:

>   The majority of venture capitalists at any given time are all chasing the
>   same Revolutionary Innovation, and it’s the Revolutionary Innovation that
>   IPO’d six months ago. This is an especially crushing observation in venture
>   capital, because there’s a direct economic motive to not follow the herd.

And what to do about it. DFJ (a VC) has a rule [favoring a passionate
minority][dfj] to outweigh a negative majority.  This also reminds me of the
[Tenth Man Rule][10man].

>   Only two partners need to agree in order to fund any startup up to $1.5
>   million. And if all the partners agree that something sounds like a good
>   idea, they won’t do it.

Movies and books have a huge effect on the human psyche. This will probably
compound with more immersive storytelling mediums:

>   So far as I can tell, few movie viewers act as if they have directly
>   observed Earth’s future. [...] But those who commit the fallacy seem to act
>   as if they had seen the movie events occurring on some other planet; not
>   Earth, but somewhere similar to Earth.

Predicting numbers is especially difficult:

>   I observe that many futuristic predictions are, likewise, best considered as
>   attitude expressions. Take the question, “How long will it be until we have
>   human-level AI?” The responses I’ve seen to this are all over the map.


#### Avoid having THE Great Idea and get granular and specific

Avoiding partisanship by focusing on the minimum viable argument, reminds me of
Sunstein's [Judicial minimalism][judmin]:

>   But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly
>   avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in
>   school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it
>   explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be
>   Republicans.

Avoid overly large uhh Thingies, and chop them up.

>   Cut up your Great Thingy into smaller independent ideas and treat them as
>   independent. For instance, a marxist would cut up Marx's Great Thingy into
>   theories of 1) value of labor 2) political relations between classes 3)
>   wages 4) the ultimate political state of mankind.


#### Other interesting stuff

Taber and Lodge's ["Motivated skepticism in the evaluation of political
beliefs"][taber] describes six predictions which are very Haidt-y. It's a list
of political thinkos that are driven by behavioral economic biases.

Beliefs don't need to be completely bullet proof. But this contradicts
science, where a single counter example can topple a theory.

>   A probabilistic model can take a hit or two, and still survive, so long as
>   the hits don’t keep on coming in. Yet it is widely believed, especially in
>   the court of public opinion, that a true theory can have no failures and a
>   false theory no successes.

On the uselessness of "Deep Wisdom":

>   Surely the wisest of all human beings are the New Age gurus who say,
>   “Everything is connected to everything else.” If you ever say this aloud,
>   you should pause, so that everyone can absorb the sheer shock of this Deep
>   Wisdom. There is a trivial mapping between a graph and its complement. A
>   fully connected graph, with an edge between every two vertices, conveys the
>   same amount of information as a graph with no edges at all.

There's a distinction between Traditional rationalism and Bayesian rationalism.
And I worry that the Bayesian variety, which Eliezer is a subscriber of, is a
sort of hedgehogginess: a very focused and blindered approach. But I liked the
idea that you can go beyond falsification, the ability to relinquish an initial
opinion when confronted by clear evidence against it.

>   I suspect that a more powerful (and more difficult) method is to hold off on
>   thinking of an answer. To suspend, draw out, that tiny moment when we can’t
>   yet guess what our answer will be; thus giving our intelligence a longer
>   time in which to act. Even half a minute would be an improvement over half a
>   second.

"Make America Great Again":

>   A key component of a zeitgeist is whether it locates its ideals in its
>   future or its past. Nearly all cultures before the Enlightenment believed in
>   a Fall from Grace – that things had once been perfect in the distant past,
>   but then catastrophe had struck, and everything had slowly run downhill
>   since then.

Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming
===
posted: August 2016
rating: maybe

I bought this book 10 years ago, and it just sat on my shelf ever since. Not
sure how I got into it in the first place, but my interest in lucid dreaming has
increased as a result of my work on VR. As I delved into questions intimately
tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner
workings of our mind.

VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory
deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences
never possible in a sense-rich environment.

I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually
interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in
my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to
understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of
lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall. So, while I'm unlikely to become an
oneironaut, at the very least I've started a handwritten dream journal, which I
keep on my bedside table.


The Persuaders (audio)
===
posted: July 2016
rating: no

Rationality used to pervade English scene. Now no appeal to reason is even
attempted.

Mostly arguments today are adversarial. In the past it was possible to have
people with differing opinions not to resort to personal attacks. Appeal to
reason hasn't always been the MO. It comes and goes and the author claims that
were in an especially reason free era.

*How crazy PR is*: Nice case study looking into the political journalistic and
other heavy machinery that is used to sway people. Particularly at the first
Iraq war (about Kuwait), and swaying public opinion to the side of the US.
Especially fascinating is the "Naira" girl who cried wolf, who claimed to be a
Kuwaiti refugee suffering in Iraqi camps, but was actually a member of the
Kuwaiti royal family. Especially interesting is the chain of money and influence
and PR firms that takes that sort of inflammatory material and inject it into
peoples' minds.  Remember "Free Kuwait" t-shirts? Courtesy of Hill and Nolton, a
PR firm which was fed this information.

Astroturfing - creating fake grassroots movements that are actually sponsored by
some corporation

Logical follow up or supplement to The Century of the Self.

- Lebeau: the crowd is lacking reason, influenced by emotion, images.
- Trotters: herd instinct, and group identity is key.
- Lippmann: anti democratic conclusion that experts should run the show, not unwashed masses. regain critical faculties by understanding how PR works. also regulatory moves to make public deception illegal.

*Soft vs. hard nudging*. fundamentally people don't always know what is best for
them, and government can step in. seatbelt laws force you to wear seat belts
always (hard paternalism). GPS navigation systems don't force you to take their
route, cigarette packs with graphic images: soft paternalism.

*Shoving will backfire*: if people feel nudged, they nudge back. U.K. had a test
which gave job seekers a strength profile that was bogus. OIRA branch of the US
and sunstein. what does the most good and least harm? regulations like showing
calorie counts in fast food, environmental friendliness of consumer products,
hidden costs in air tickets and credit card fees. good defaults matter too.

*Reason > nudging*: reason based decisions will be more generally effective.
rather than appealing to some auto response, if you can reach the underlying
understanding, you're better off.

Some weaknesses: some parts, especially the ad related section, lists a lot of
studies, but not the strengths of the effect. Also, largely a derivative work,
mainly a summarization of other works: "Thinking Fast and Slow", "The Hidden
Persuaders", "Orality and Literacy".

Strongest part: chapter 5 about politics, etc.

*Efficacy of arguments*: if dealing with people that agree already (eg. DNC to
Democrats), provide a one-sided argument. Otherwise, go both ways. Discrediting
the other POV is effective.


The Righteous Mind by Jon Haidt
===
posted: July 2016
rating: yes

I discovered The Righteous Mind via [Jon Haidt's conversation with Sam
Harris][evolving-minds]. I read it while on our Honeymoon, while Sarah was
enjoying another book about morality. It was very romantic! Anyway, some
thoughts on the book:

Haidt presents his argument in three parts. It's well structured, and super well
written:

1. Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second (ie. people's morality is
   driven by intuition/gut reactions, and then they are really good at
   justifying their position through reasoning)
2. There's more to morality than harm and fairness (ie. conservatives care about
   many other things: authority, loyalty, sanctity -- this is the foundation of
   Moral Foundation Theory)
3. Morality binds and blinds (ie. arguments around group selection, social
   cohesion and other benefits of religion and partisanship)


*Not moral relativism*. In addition to borrowing from anthropology, Haidt
recounts a personal story of his visit to India, and how initial visceral
discomfort eventually transformed into some understanding of the cultural
context he found himself in:

>   Understanding the simple fact that morality differs around the world, and even
>   within societies, is the first step toward understanding your righteous mind.

I don't think that this is moral relativism, but moral descriptivism. Haidt does
not claim that morality *ought* to differ around the world, simply that it does
differ.

*Nice analogies*: I found the analogy of a small rider (the rational) riding a
large elephant (the intuitive) apt and useful. Sort of like a lizard brain
idea. 

>   The elephant is far more powerful than the rider, but it is not an absolute
>   dictator.

>   Under normal circumstances the rider takes its cue from the elephant, just
>   as a lawyer takes instructions from a client. But if you force the two to
>   sit around and chat for a few minutes, the elephant actually opens up to
>   advice from the rider.


*Against rationalism*: Haidt presents an interesting argument against moral
rationalism. Firstly, he makes a compelling case for religion as something that
increases social capital via group selection, arguing against the New Atheist
view that religion is evil, period, with no redeeming qualities.

Haidt argues for the Humeian view of morality, and against Bentham's utilitarian
and Kant's deontological positions:

>   As Western societies became more educated, industrialized, rich, and
>   democratic, the minds of its intellectuals changed. They became more
>   analytic and less holistic.26 Utilitarianism and deontology became far more
>   appealing to ethicists than Hume’s messy, pluralist, sentimentalist
>   approach.

Haidt finds support for Hume's position, which is that intuition (or sentiment)
comes first, and then reason tries really hard to come up with arguments to
support that position. Haidt's subjects were

>   Morally dumbfounded — rendered speechless by their inability to explain
>   verbally what they knew intuitively. These subjects were reasoning. They
>   were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of
>   truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions.

*On changing minds*:

>   The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with
>   other people.

>   If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the
>   “other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying,
>   and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. You may not agree,
>   but you’ll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful
>   and constructive yin-yang disagreement

He presents a framework for how this can happen:

![Social intuitionist model](http://i.imgur.com/0TIx3sN.png)

>   Intuitions come first and reasoning is usually produced after a judgment is
>   made, in order to influence other people. But as a discussion progresses, we
>   sometimes change our intuitions and judgements.

*Against Rawls*:

>   Beware of anyone who insists that there is one true morality for all people,
>   times, and places—particularly if that morality is founded upon a single
>   moral foundation. Human societies are complex; their needs and challenges
>   are variable.

*Salient critiques of the left*:

>   If you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not
>   consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you’re asking for
>   trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It
>   explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist
>   revolutions usually end up in despotism.

*Conservative thinkers*, like Frederich Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Jerry Muller, and
Edmond Burke.  I ought to read them! Also, distinctions between conservatism and
orthodoxy:

>   Christians who look to the Bible as a guide for legislation, like Muslims
>   who want to live under sharia, are examples of orthodoxy. They want their
>   society to match an externally ordained moral order, so they advocate
>   change, sometimes radical change.  This can put them at odds with true
>   conservatives, who see radical change as dangerous

2016 is a very confusing year. The media appears to have completely lost its
ability to reason about or predict future political outcomes. Trump's
nomination, Brexit, the rise of populism all over the world, appears mysterious
and scary. In my left coast circles, the right is generally portrayed as
either rich and evil, or poor and dumb.

The Righteous Mind provides a more convincing explanation for contemporary
political divisions around differences in morality. Rather than just identifying
low intellect, sheepishness, or fascist tendencies with right leaning populists,
Haidt offers a useful framework for understanding the conservative world view.
This book is a must read for any political observer with any hope for
understanding.

Must Mankind Repeat History's Great Mistakes
===
posted: July 2016

Nice insight and guiding theme: international politics is complicated because
there isn't really an organization that stands above all nations. Unlike other
human endeavors, if a rogue entity misbehaves, there isn't really anyone to go
to by default. Each country has its own skin to worry about, and they need to
figure out the best strategy.

I liked the concept of the balance of power, presented in 3 versions by the
lecturer:

1. Simply the distribution of existing power.
2. The state in which all parties in question have equal power
3. A tendency for new power entering a conflict to join the weak side in order
   to avoid a monopoly of power.

After one or two theoretical lectures, the course ventured into territory of
WW1, the interwar years, and WW2. I found this part to be somewhat less engaging
since most of the historical details were review for me, and little of the
theory introduced at the beginning was brought into the fold. The last lecture
was more interesting, since it tried to apply the theory introduced at the
beginning to predict the future. What made it even more interesting is the fact
that the lecture was recorded in the early 90s.

The lecturer wasn't very engaging, and I found myself listening to a lot of the
lectures without getting much out of them. Additionally, the volume was low and
the recording was poor quality, which contributed to my meta objections.

The Man Who Loved Only Numbers
===
posted: July 2016
rating: yes

I really loved this one. It captures perfectly the quirkiness of Erdos, and his
mathematician circles. Much more than a biography, this book popularizes a lot
of incredibly interesting mathematics. It took me back 10 years to my math
undergrad days.

The author does an incredible job of capturing the essence of many complex
mathematical concepts in appealing and entertaining ways. It's instructive to
compare the way this book tackles certain topics to the corresponding Wikipedia
page, which is completely undecipherable by a non-mathematician, and often even
by a mathematician that doesn't work in that domain. That said, I'm  not sure
that this book would be as appreciated by someone without a background in math.
But it may serve as inspiration for a motivated, mathematically-inclined high
school student. I'll find out!

Despite having spent 4 years taking a bunch of math courses,  I learned a lot of
new math from this book, and was reminded by some favorites.

Ramsey Theory: the inevitability of order in large quantities. We barely touched
on Ramsey theory in 4th year Graph Theory, and it seemed really obscure. Not
true! Draw any 5 points on a plane, and as long as 3 of them don't form a line,
you are guaranteed to be able to form a convex quad using them as vertices. Take
any sequence of 101 numbers, and you're guaranteed to find a subsequence of at
least 10 increasing numbers.

Infinite series: a technical subject, but some really incredible results, like
Taylor expansions of e (sum of 1/k!), pi (6 times sum of 1/k^2).

Cantor's analysis of various infinities (alpha numbers): firstly the beautiful
argument about the countability of rational numbers, and then the famous
diagonalization argument which proves that the set of real numbers is a bigger
infinity.


Mother of All Demos
===
posted: June 2016
rating: yes

Took some notes from the famous [Doug Englebart
demo](http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/extra4/sloan/mousesite/1968Demo.html).

As a Human Computer Interaction nerd, I feel the need to pay homage to history
of the field. One glaring omission in my education is that I haven't fully
watched "The Demo" where Douglas Englebart shows off the state of the art of
"Man-Computer Interaction" circa 1968. The subject of the demo is NLS (Online
system), which is intended as a synthesis of a bunch of ideas coming from SRI.
It's quite impressive how far we've come, but also how many elements are still
recognizable, and in some cases impressively ahead of their time.

The first ten minutes introduce a series of key concepts that are staples of
desktop computing: the mouse and keyboard, mouse pointers, copy/paste, saving
and loading files, numbered lists. Less mainstream, VI-like features are also
introduced, such as reorderable, heirarchical lists, and folding sections.
Much of what goes on under the hood in NLS reminded me of VIM script and other
similar DSLs. Big focus on expert-oriented power usage.

The Demo heavily alludes to the web, with a lot of provisions for interlinking,
cross referencing, and even an explicit mention of ARPA close to the end of the
demo (Clip 33), which reminds the viewer that this is all pre-Intenet. In
contrast, their (presumably telephone-based) video calling was quite impressive.
The quality of the remote speaker seemed to be about as good (bad?) as
Englebart's. Some collaborative features were quite impressive, with a real-time
cursor sharing scheme which was decades ahead of its time. Others were less
interesting, like leaving a message for other people in a file to "get a
response within minutes".

Some time is spent showing off hardware. Most interestingly is the
[Keyset](http://dougengelbart.org/firsts/keyset.html), which was a 5-key
ancestor of the chorded keyboard, where each key combination (31 in total) led
to a character, and was intended as a one handed keyboard. Also interesting as a
point of comparison was the cutting edge display tech of the time: black and
white CRTs with 15 Hz refresh rates and super high (3 frame) persistence.

The philosophy of the lab behind MOAD was close to my heart, and lives on in R&D
groups I've had the pleasure of being part of:

- Build and try: big focus on prototyping!
- Evolutionary: make incremental improvements to a real system, not grand visions.
- Eat your own dogfood: use the thing you build, and test it on yourself.


The One Minute Manager
===
posted: June 2016
rating: yes

This little book was recommended to me by a ski instructor after a ski lesson at
Squaw.  The man was probably in his 70s, but skied incredibly well, and had a
lot of wisdom to pass on. He was tough, but nice, like a One Minute Manager.

More of a pamphlet than a book, One Minute Manager unfolds as a story about a
young man wanting to learn to be a good people manager. The story makes the
points more vivid, but at its core, there is an interesting and somewhat
surprising strategy outlined for being a good hands off manager. The approach
reminds me a little bit of Christian's management style. There are three parts:

1. Set goals and expectations with the employee, write them down succinctly and
   have them ready for review. (This is similar to Google OKRs, and definitely
   worthwhile).
2. Especially early on, look for behaviors that are praise-worthy, and give due
   praise honestly and directly. (This seems like a great idea to try on
   interns).
3. Reprimand unwanted behavior as it happens, but emphasize their worth as
   people. (This seems quite hard to pull off without being a dick).


Gantenbein by Max Frisch
===
posted: June 2016
rating: yes

Gantenbein was recommended to me by a close friend, who said it made a really
big impact on him. It took me a long time to get through this book, and I often
struggled to follow the narrative. The author writes in a very experimental
style, alternating between three different men, all of which are in love with
Lila, a beautiful stage actress. Events that happen don't seem to have
chronology or causation. Sometimes they branch out into multiple futures, other
times you reset in another time, another place, and as another person.  The book
is a set of sketches around these people, more so than a coherent whole. Adding
to the complexity, the narrator himself seems to not be a single person, but
alternates between people. And this smoke and mirrors is explicit. The author
often writes "I imagine...", and the title is more accurately translated "Let's
assume my name is Gantenbein".

I found this book to be a piercing view into human nature. I could relate to
much of what the characters within it struggle with, which made reading it
difficult and slow. Gantenbein, one of the protagonists, decides to pretend to
be blind for his whole life, and builds a relationship with Lila. He wears dark
glasses, which conceal his lie from others. But he himself has to be careful not
to reveal his secret. He can see, but must pretend that he can't, and this leads
to painful allegory on good relationships.

This book was hard to read. I never got into a flow, and ended up reading very
unevenly, often wanting to set it down for a while. But some parts I really
loved, like when one of the characters attends his own funeral. And I was
surprised to, after finishing it, have a feeling that some coherence emerged by
the end. My understanding of this book would benefit from a re-reading, but I
know that this is unlikely to happen.



Physics Beyond the Edge (audio)
===
posted: June 2016
rating: yes

An interesting follow up to what I remember from high school & first year
physics. My guess is that the subject of the class is too basic for those with a
degree in physics, but this is something I should ask Alex! I really liked how
all of the topics flowed into each other. I found this to be somewhat surprising
given Einstein's failed struggle to find some unified theory of everything. This
is probably credit to the lecturer, who, in addition to being a great
instructor, also coined the term [qubit][].

The structure of the class follows Arthur C. Clark's second law:

>   The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a
>   little way past them into the impossible.

The lecturer, Benjamin Schumacher, is quite engaging, and starts by breaking
impossibility down in terms of logical, physical and statistical terms. He then
goes into thermodynamics, framing the first and second laws in terms of
[perpetual motion machines][pmm].

I enjoyed the various Demons that show up in this lecture. [Maxwell's
demon][maxwell] can control a flap between two chambers to make sure that
eventually all of the molecules end up in one of the chambers (thus decreasing
entropy). [Laplace's demon][laplace] is able to, from knowing the current state
of the world, predict the future perfectly. Both of these thought experiments
are forays into the impossible that, when disproven, set the stage for the third
law of thermodynamics and chaos / quantum mechanics.

The section on space-time was fascinating, and served as a good introduction to
space-time diagrams (aka [Minkowski diagrams][minkowski]), which I really liked.
Although, one thing that was missing is the visual element. Although very
lightweight in mathematical treatment, there were clearly some materials that
supplemented the lectures, which would have made learning easier. The whole
discussion on faster-than-light travel, time travel, and quantum cloning was
tied together nicely through the lens of the impossible. By the way, space-time
diagrams seem to be the reason for this [observable universe
thing][observable-universe].

Which brings us to Quantum. I've been interested in being interested in the
topic for a while because it's so unintuitive and strange. Schumacher's
overview is good, but I'm obviously still very confused. He outlines basics of
Quantum Mechanics:

1. Wave-particle duality: light has both wave and particle like behaviors.
2. Uncertainty: position and momentum of a quantum particle cannot both be
   known.
3. Tunneling: because of this uncertainty, quantum particles can tunnel through
   what in newtonian mechanics are inpenetrable barriers.

There seem to be some fundamental truths about symmetry as pertaining to
conservation laws. [Noether's theorem][noether] seems remarkably deep but way
over my head, which states that every symmetry in physics has some associated
conservation law.

I was also somewhat lost in the information theory asides (the lecturer's
specialty is information theory). That information theory is a branch of physics
at all is mysterious to me. Probably worth learning more about, though, given my
information-related profession.

Great Ideas of Philosophy (audio)
===
posted: May 2016
rating: yes

Really great series of 60 lectures – that's 24 hours worth as an overview of
philosophers and their main points. I took very few sporadic notes, as the
majority of my listening was done while riding a bicycle. Here are some of my
favorite philosophers and their quotes:

Thomas Reid's principle of credulity:

>   If no proposition that is uttered in discourse would be believed, until it
>   was examined and tried by reason … most men would be unable to find reasons
>   for believing the thousandth part of what is told them. Such distrust and
>   incredulity would deprive us of the greatest benefits of society.

[Wittgenstein's beetle][wittgenstein]:

>   Imagine, he says, that everyone has a small box in which they keep a beetle.
>   However, no one is allowed to look in anyone else’s box, only in their own. Over
>   time, people talk about what is in their boxes and the word “beetle” comes to
>   stand for what is in everyone’s box.

Everything about [Socrates][socrates]. This is a treasure trove to be revisited.

>   The unexamined life is not worth living.

The stoic mindset, especially this quote attributed to [Epictetus][epictetus]:

>   Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned it."

Kant's Categorical Imperative, in a few formulations:

>   Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that
>   it should become a universal law without contradiction.	

...and

>   Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in
>   the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at
>   the same time as an end.	

and...

>   Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim
>   always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.	


And closely related, Rawls' [Original Position][rawls], although the lecturer
[Daniel N. Robinson][danrobinson] is surprisingly dismissive of his ideas.

Karl Popper's ideas around [falsification][popper]:

>   Falsifiability or refutability of a statement, hypothesis, or theory is the
>   inherent possibility that it can be proven false. A statement is called
>   falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which
>   negates the statement in question. In this sense, falsify is synonymous with
>   nullify, meaning to invalidate or "show to be false".

The debate between realism and anti-realism: whether or not scientific theory
describes what the world is actually like, or if it just serves as a nice model.
A succinct summary of the two positions:

>   Realists see scientific inquiry as discovery while anti-realists sees it as
>   invention.

Clarence Irving Lewis and the idea of qualia, especially well illustrated in
["Mary's room"][mary], which produces an interesting anti-materialist argument:

>   The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective
>   picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller
>   knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes
>   set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.

After nearly 24 hours of lecturing, Daniel synthesizes a lot of philosophical
thought into what constitutes a good life:

- Fatalism: being OK with your fate.
- Hedonism: the good kind, aiming to increase long term pleasure.
- Selflessness: benevolent, philanthropic behavior
- Activity: don't become a brain in a vat :)

How to Fail at Almost Everything by Scott Adams
===
posted: April 2016
rating: no

(...including writing books)

Let's be clear: this is a self help book. I somehow got suckered into reading it
because I liked one of his blog posts. There are very few interesting or
original things in the book, and the author comes off as brash and trying too hard
to be funny. That said, I liked some ideas:

- Systems vs goals. Focusing on achievement leads to emptiness after the fact.
    Instead focus on a system and process. 

- Simplifiers vs optimizers is an interesting dichotomy. Usually it's about
    optimizers vs satisficers but in this case I can see myself as a simplifier. 

- Don't listen to friends and family feedback on business ideas. Listen to the market. 

Most of the rest of the book can be reduced to common sense: eat well, exercise
daily. Some of Scott's specific advice is really uninspired and downright
depressing. He insists that you should learn to play golf, learn a second
language, how to use proper English grammar, how to be outgoing, a good
conversationalist and a public speaker. He devotes a chapter of the book to
learning a special command voice in order to manipulate people better. Move
along!


Art of Tidying by Marie Kondo
===
posted: April 2016
rating: no

An endearing manual for tidying up. I'm naturally inclined to minimalism as it
stands and did a massive cleanup of my old room in my parents house just last
month so consider myself proficient. But Marie takes it to the next level,
revealing an autistic inclination towards the personification of inanimate
objects.

This manifesto can easily be reduced to an illustrated one pager, but Marie
insists on treading over the same ground multiple times.

1. Discard everything you don't need by determining if it sparks joy. Go by
   category, starting with clothes, moving on to books and personal items.
2. Once you've donated garbage bags full of items, organize them so that
   everything you own has a place. Stand everything including clothes
   vertically.

By the end if the book I was curious more about Marie's eccentricity than her
organizational method.

The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris
===
posted: March 2016
rating: yes

In many ways a rehashing of many ideas in philosophy, I think Sam did a good job
of bringing some longstanding ideas and debates to the fore without requiring a
degree in philosophy. The section on religion can be skipped, since he rehashes
old theses from End of Faith (oh yeah, hobby horse!)

The overall thesis is that the well being of conscious entities is of supreme
importance, and that morality is all about optimizing that. Intuitively, I agree
that this is a good, pragmatic, and secular definition. I am less interested in the
philosophical debate around it, but I don't think Sam adequately addresses the
other side of the argument adequately. Debates between utilitarian ideas and
other branches of philosophy have been raging for centuries, and with all due
respect, I don't think Sam is the guy to put them to rest.

Despite well being's illusive nature, Sam draws a parallel to health, which is
also difficult to pin down precisely. While the analogy is illustrative, health
is easier to define, and has been done out of practical necessity with metrics
like QALYs. Though flawed, a QALY-like metric that includes all aspects of well
being seems out of reach in 2016.

With that said, Sam hedges heavily against this reality, and repeatedly says
that we may not know what the best collective course of action is, but that one
(or in fact many) must surely exist. These many local maxima are the peaks of
The Moral Landscape.


A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller Jr
===
posted: February 2016
rating: yes

Amazing.

A masterpiece in three parts. The setting is post apocalyptic earth after a
mutually assured nuclear destruction scenario occurred in the 20th century.

While most of humanity has undergone the simplification, a small order of
Christian monks is dedicated to preserving human civilization. Their patron
saint, St. Leibowitz, an engineer from before The Deluge. After a bomb shelter
with his blueprint is discovered by a primitive monk, a religious scandal
unfolds, reminiscent of what might have happened in the dark ages to Galileo.

Many centuries later the blueprint is finally understood by a scientist
frustrated by a lack of truly novel discoveries. And an engineer from the same
order builds it. It is a simple electrical generator which powersq a lamp.

Eventually humanity returns to its pre Deluge level of technology and surpasses
it, achieving the ability to travel to exoplanets. But political strife is once
again at an alarming level. And as earth nears nuclear annihilation again, the
order of leibowitz prepares to preserve the blueprints and other critical
documents and send them, along with a small order of monks, to another planet
for resettlement.

The characters are vividly painted, and the historical projection of the dark
ages onto a modern technological background is fascinating and masterfully
crafted. The book serves as a stark reminder that there is no natural
progression toward better  times, and just how fragile our current paradise is.

The threat of nuclear war may feel like a bygone but I'm quite concerned about
it still.
