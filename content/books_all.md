Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr
===
posted: April 13, 2020
rating: yes

I first learned of this book after a quick conversation with Mark, whom I’ve only met once in-person. I was just finishing Debt, and found the book intriguing, especially the parts about the monetary systems in Islamic societies. Mark suggested this book, and indeed it covers a period of history that I know basically nothing about. With my interest piqued already, I decided to take the plunge.

This book was both broad and deep, covering an era from about 750 (a nominal end of the Arab conquest) through 1150 (roughly the time when intellectual fruits of the enlightenment were starting to wilt). It is well written, so in the moment you think you understand what’s happening, but afterwards it turns out that everything is really complicated.

My overall feeling after reading this book is that it serves well as a comprehensive introduction to the topic. But the topic is quite complex, and as a complete noob, I found myself struggling a little bit. As I write this summary, I constantly have to consult Wikipedia to understand the region and its civilizational chronology. Keeping track of the giant cast of ancient Arab, Turkish, and Mongol characters that the author presents is also a challenge. On the other hand, the introduction really hooked me and the first half of the book flowed very well. I did come close to abandoning the book about 3/4 through, especially since the Turkish empires just before the Mongol invasion seemed to be somewhat dull from both action and cultural perspectives. But it picks up again with Genghis Khan and Timur and their respective empires, and then the conclusion does a great job of tying it all together. I listened to the last chapter twice!

I don't know why, but these Soviet stamps of great Islamic scientists are really
appealing:

# Where: cities and regions

I left myself a TODO as I was summarizing: “understand all of the cities/regions? mentioned in this book, put them on a map. Who would have been living there at the time? And maybe one day visit them.” So far, I only have [a Google map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r3caNCqtH91TXpF2rug03XzKByZ1BkdL&usp=sharing), but it’s a start! The trip may have to wait for global pandemics and regional instabilities to wane.

Throughout the book, it was never clear which name corresponded to a city, and which to a region. Trying to resolve this online isn’t that simple. One is confounded by inconsistent Latinization. Khwarazm has been known also as Chorasmia, Khaurism, Khwarezm, Khwarezmia, Khwarizm, Khwarazm, Khorezm, Khoresm, Khorasam, Kharazm, Harezm, Horezm, and Chorezm. 

Here’s a crazy tidbit: by 1200, Merv (aka Marv, Merw, Mary, …) was the largest city in the world with possibly half a million souls. Thousands were employed just to maintain its irrigation systems. Yet I hadn’t even heard of the place. Much of central Asian architecture of the time was lost because buildings were not built out of stone but of more perishable materials. But the cities were huge and glorious for their time, according to eyewitnesses. 

Later into the book, there were some familiar places mentioned which helped me anchor a bit. My dad’s business trips to Taskhent, Almaty in the heart of the region where some of my friends were born, as well as song references: the [Tian Shan mountains, lake Issik Kul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmfjt0DnfCs). I love it when I have multiple angles on the same concept. It feels like things snap into place!

# Why did the Islamic golden age happen?

- Hardship and need for water meant complex irrigation systems required advances in science and technology.
- Subsequent general prosperity (great harvests) meant intellectuals could devote time to science and art. 
- Social norms from pre-Islam: rulers needed to patronize the arts to show their greatness. 
- Religious pluralism: Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Zoroastrianism were common and coexisted. As Islamic scholars documented each prior culture, they adopted pieces of it.

# Why did the golden age end?

The author does a good job dismantling Sonia Brenkes’ argument that there was no decline, and that westerners are just culturally insensitive. I liked that. Starr illustrates a clear decline both quantitatively and qualitatively. He puts a lot of the blame on Sunni-Shia conflicts and restrictions in freedoms of expression. Universities languished while madrasas thrived. Printing took a very long time to be adopted. 

The Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavids, Empires that followed Timur and the period covered in the book, were rich and powerful, but focused on aesthetics, art, and architecture over science. Many great books crumbled from neglect over this period. Europeans were the ones who launched efforts to preserve the ailing manuscripts. 

The decline happened sometime around 1100. Starr enumerates many potential reasons for the decline, and rejects each in turn:

- Climate change: the region’s climate hasn't changed much then to now. The efforts of the oasis irrigators were thwarted when the mongols came to power, but this was after the decline. 
- Innate tendencies of Mongols: mongols came well after the start of the decline so cannot be the cause. 
- Vasco de Gamma, because his sea route opened trade which impoverished the land routes: unlikely, since the sea route was encouraged by high tariffs and bandits along the land routes. Also intellectual decay came before economic decay. Great Caravanserai were built in 11 and 12th centuries.
- Decline in patronage from rich nobles and split up of large empires into emirates: the same laws were in place during cultural vitality, same ability to donate to foundations. But at the point of decline, money went to madrasas and not individual creators. 
- The Turks sucked, but the Persians were awesome: There were definitely greats among the Turks though. 
- A decline of large empires: Timur’s was the last, but again this splintering happened well after the start of the decline.

Ultimately the author decides the main reason for decline is a rift between Sunni and Shiite sects that led to a surge in intolerance. Rational thought and science was caught on the crossfire between the two. Great thinkers like Al-Ghazali gave firepower for restrictive legalistic interpretation of Sharia which led to tighter links between religion and statecraft. Also the rise of Sufism turned society to metaphysics and away from science.

# Great people and their ideas

I didn’t get a great sense for the full impact of the intellectual output of Central Asia during this golden age. It still seems to me like the largest contributions were preserving Greek works, and popularizing Indian mathematics.

Great thinkers found themselves between three fundamental camps intuition, reason, and revelation. At first, reason reigned, math ([Al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi)) science ([Al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni)) and medicine ([Ibn Sina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna)) flourished, free thinkers ([Al-Razi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi)) were given a platform, and strange Islamic-rationalist hybrids went to great extremes. Later, the mood changed and revelation became the last word ([Al-Ghazali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali)).

## Al-Kwarazmi’s mathematics

Al-Khwarizmi (780 - 850) was a popularizer of mathematics and integrated the Indian invented decimal notation system into his works. He wrote practical books for tradesmen to apply mathematics to their craft, formalizing some algebraic manipulations. He and many others exemplified the sort of mathematical, physical, medical intellectual activity of the time.

## Extremely rational Islam!?

For a time, reason was so revered in the Islamic world, that rationalist schools of Islamic theology emerged. The adherents of the [Muʿtazili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila) school are best known for rejecting the widely accepted doctrine of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, deducing that if the Quran is the word of God, he logically "must have preceded his own speech".

The movement reached its political height in 833 under Caliph al-Ma'mun, when Sunni and Shia scholars were punished, imprisoned, or even killed unless they conformed to Muʿtazila doctrine. The policy lasted for fifteen years, continuing through the reigns of al-Ma'mun's immediate successors.

## Ibn-Sina and Al-Biruni debate

Ibn Sina (980 – 1037) and Al-Biruni (973 - 1050) were contemporaries and had a public debate which took place over many years and can be traced in their preserved letters. This feels very modern, western renaissance-y, and they dug deep into fundamental questions. If heat rises, how does the sun’s heat reach the earth? Was Aristotle right that planets have neither weight nor mass?

Biruni focused on physics and mathematics and reason. He was an empiricist at heart, and very practical. Biruni definitely has the author’s sympathies (and mine, of course), and seems like the winner on almost all counts. He seems ridiculously advanced in many ways, often having really good hunches for science that would be discovered 500 years later. Biruni suggested that maybe orbits could be elliptical, which was shocking given previous assumptions that movement can only be linear or circular. He somehow knew and wrote about fossils, which is very surprising given a recently [Long Now talk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/art-science-deep-time-conceiving-inconceivable-in-19th/id1246993791?i=1000464847732), which dates the first European fossil discoveries to the 19th century.

In many cases in the debate, Ibn Sina was right, like suggesting that light does not emanate from the eyes, as was the platonic ideal, but instead comes from the world. 

## Al-Ghazali’s anti-rationalism

Al-Ghazali (1058 - 1111) was a philosopher and theologian that studied with rationalists but adopted an anti-rationalist stance and sided with islamic mystics. 

Meanwhile the sultanate became more extreme and intolerant, and Al-Ghazali gave them the theory on which to justify their politics, confidently suggesting that philosophers were apostates, and that even after a conversion to Islam, the subject may be a closeted unbeliever. Thus if a philosopher fell out of favor with authorities he could be labeled an apostate and effectively lynched.

Al-Ghazali’s patron was killed, forcing him to change directions towards Sufism, a rising branch of Islamic mysticism. He justified his new path as the best possible life for all people with his characteristic zeal. 

In [The Incoherence of the Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers), Al-Ghazali solved many problems at once, explaining his popularity:

1. Devastating weapons to use against philosophers.
2. Justified moving Sufism into central Muslim life.
3. Shifted political and intellectual atmosphere from philosophizing from first principles to sharia law.

Al-Ghazali influences many theologians and philosophers, from Acquinas to Hume to Maimonides. 

A wise modern science administrator once quipped, “an active scientist is always right, and the younger he is, the more right he is”. In contrast, Al-Ghazali wrote:

> The most important truths are already fully accessible in the Quran and Hadiths and are embodied in the Sharia. Faith, not science and rigorous thought, is the key to unlocking them. It it is most likely to appear among the elders (Aksakals) or Sufi masters whose lifelong pursuit of wisdom gives them the right and duty to teach the young. Let them impart wisdom, and let the young listen.”


## Omar Khayyam

Omar Khayyam was a great scientist and mathematician from Nishapur, active during the Seljuk era. It was only in his old age and exile from Merv, he turned to wine and poetry for which he is most known today. He watched in horror Al-Ghazali rose to prominence.

# Chronology

Most of what follows is chronological-ish summary of what happened in the region before, during, and after the Islamic enlightenment.

## Before the Arab conquest (pre-622)

This was the time of the first mounted horses, the first saddles in the first stirrups. This gave the Central Asians huge advantage over chariots. In addition it made them more mobile and nomadic. However these were not the stereotypical nomads that conflicted with city dwellers. These peoples needed goods that would come from cities, and the author paints a rather convivial picture of the two groups of people living in relative harmony. Central Asian cities were large and flexible in relation to Mediterranean cities which were quite fragile and small.
￼￼￼￼￼
Due to the harsh conditions of the region, engineers really needed to build solid irrigation systems. And the public understood this, and so technocrats were elevated in status. A lot of technical domains involved passing knowledge down from generation to generation, as a result of these professions were often practiced by groups of ethnically homogeneous people. For example glassblowing was predominantly Jewish practice. The pre-Islamic Central Asians were super literate. Sadly, little is left of that era because the Arabs burned a lot of their books in their invasion. ￼￼￼

The arid conditions were such that cities had to be built around oases which were pretty far spaced from one another. This meant that you couldn't really have large empires, as in Egypt for example all along the Nile.

Zoroastrianism was dominant in the area and had a huge impact on major world religions. I know nothing about it other than that “Thus Spake Zarathustra” song. Apparently Zoroaster invented the idea of heaven, hell, and redemption.

By 800, Roman roads were no longer needed and fell into disrepair. Instead, camels were very actively used for transport of goods but they couldn't carry as much weight as wheeled carts so trade skewed towards materials that were especially valuable and not particularly heavily. This is the “silk road”, although silk was just one of many goods, including lapis lazuli, emeralds, gold and other precious metals, ferried across this route. Dromedary or single humped camel's were phased out in favor of Bactrian (two hump) camels who are more hardy.

### Fate of old books

Interesting trend of book burning by conquering civilizations. A Chinese dynasty referred to in Debt also burned all records kept before them. And the conquering Muslims burned huge swaths of history, impeding historians even today. But not all book destruction was so sudden, a lot of Islamic enlightenment books were simply allowed to decompose through neglect.


## Arab conquest (622-661)

First the conquest in Central Asia proceeded slowly. Over centuries it rolled out, also stunted by internal conflict within the Islamic faith, the schism between followers of Mohameds direct line and the Ussayids.  Echoes of which continue to this day with the Sunni Shia rift. 

### Islamic schism cheat sheet

After Muhammad’s death, a schism emerged in Islam: who can lead the Muslim world? Two main factions:

1. Any Muslim can lead (Umayyad Caliphate, 661 - 750). Now known as Sunni (HQ: Saudi Arabia)
2. Only blood descendants of Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law and appointed heir, can lead (Abbasid Caliphate, 750 - 1258). Now known as Shia (HQ: Iran)

## Umayyads (661 - 750)

A particularly vicious conqueror [Qutayba ibn Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutayba_ibn_Muslim) (Umayyad) set out to finally quell central Asian forces. He was uncharacteristically brutal, likely out of a lack of self confidence. He was responsible for burning whole libraries of Zoroastrian works at Buchara, and killing and enslaving thousands brutally. Seeking certainty, Qutayba asked his forces to swear fealty to him, and was met with silence, only to be murdered days later. 

Following Qutayba came a more moderate governor and general [Nasr ibn Sayyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasr_ibn_Sayyar) who undid some of the more draconian policies, but only after a series of terrible mistakes which alienated the indigenous population, by first levying a tax on non Muslims, then having a mass conversion which undid the tax base, and then a law which forced men to prove their faith by undergoing circumcision.

## Abbasids (750 - 1258)

Ultimately a general named [Abu Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Muslim) consolidated a lot of power in Central Asia, was quite heterogenous in his faith and grew a large coalition army consisting mostly of central Asians. Ultimately these forces obliterated the remaining Umayyads in Damascus and quelled the Chinese forces to the East. 

[Al-Mansur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mansur) was selected to rule the Abbasids, who were at this point concerned about Abu Muslim’s faith and loyalty. Mansur was a hard liner and didn't trust Abu Muslim, ultimately having him killed in hopes of stamping out any form of Shiism and quelling Central Asian influence. He dumped Abu Muslim’s body in the Tigris. This effectively martyred the man, who was extremely popular, and led to many more rebellions against the already unpopular Abbasid rulers. Many of these claimed to be in Abu Muslim’s blood line, including [Al-Muqanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Muqanna), famously wearing a green face mask, inspiring stories by Borges and Moore.

> Much the way Greek culture eventually conquered a triumphant Rome, Central Asian culture was now in position to conquer the Abbasids and their new capital, Baghdad. 


### Baghdad modeled after Merv (762)

The most culturally important city of the time, [Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_city_of_Baghdad) was essentially a planned circular city, likely modelled after Merv’s administrative centre, with Merv-imported architects and craftsmen central in the planning and construction. It was built my Al-Mansur, the same Abassids caliph that killed Abu Muslim. Parts of the city were named in honor of Merv too, including a street and a quarter. 

[Harun al-Rashid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid), Al-Mansur’s grandson eventually became caliph. His leadership coincided with a golden age in Baghdad, exemplified by the legendary [House of Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom), the Grand Library of Baghdad. His rise to power was in part sponsored by the [Barmakids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmakids), a very rich family of central Asian heritage and with deep Buddhist roots. They were great sponsors of science, medicine, and philosophy. They are most famously known for having translated large numbers of classic Greek texts into Arabic.

Translations were selective. Only Greek texts, no Latin works were translated. Also no tragedies, history, or drama was translated, mostly focused on philosophy and medicine and science. 

Baghdad has a glorious phase as described in 1001 nights, but descended into a regression that lasted several generations. Ultimately it's golden age was relatively short lived and the cultural and scientific centre shifted back to central Asian cities. 

### Decline of Baghdad (808)

Baghdad's golden age was short. The new caliph realized that Central Asia would need its autonomy and expanded the area of [Khorasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan) under [Tahir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahir_ibn_Husayn), his appointed governor. Tahir promptly declared independence and Khorasan continued to be a client state, paying tribute to Baghdad but largely autonomous. 

> Khorasan comprised the present territories of northeastern Iran, parts of Afghanistan and much of Central Asia. The province was often subdivided into four quarters. Nishapur (present-day Iran), Marv (present-day Turkmenistan), Herat and Balkh (present-day Afghanistan) were the centers, respectively, of the westernmost, northernmost, southernmost, and easternmost quarters

Tahir’s son took over after his deceased father and instituted broad minded educational reforms, insisting that even the poor farmers need to be educated. Simultaneously, there was some unrest among the patricians of the city. The rift was around a more or less literal interpretation of the Quran, but ultimately which of the two camps would wield power over the other. Ultimately the whole land owning class gently self destructed. 

[Nishapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur) was the cultural capital in the 9th century, and on the backdrop described above, much philosophical activity ensured. From hardcore Islamist literalists to militant atheists, to Aristotelian rationalists that were still fervent Muslims. 

A populist band of brothers, [Ya'qub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%27qub_ibn_al-Layth_al-Saffar) and his younger led a rebellion against the Abbasid caliph, threatening Baghdad. Barely Islamic at all, this band restored even more autonomy to the central Asian area of Khorasan. Eventually defeated, he and his younger brother briefly formed the [Saffarid dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffarid_dynasty), autonomous large chunk of Central Asia.

## Samanid Empire (819 – 999)

Samanid state was founded by four brothers; Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas. Each took control over a large city in the region. Ultimately one of them took over but did so bloodlessly, removing just brothers from power without killing them.

The Samanid allowed for a more diverse cultural base, keeping Arabic but also allowing indigenous languages: Persian, Turkic. This ultimately paved the way for more Turkish influence in the region.

## The Kara-Khanids (990 - 1040)

The [Kara-Khanids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Khanid_Khanate), Turkish nomads began moving west. As the Samanid empire was declining, they made easy targets. They converted to Islam (from their native Tengrism) but weren't especially religious. Where they invaded Central Asia from the east and gained control over large chunks of it, they erected incredibly tall minarets known as victory towers, such as the [Kalyan minaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyan_minaret). They were mostly militaristic and remained true to their steppe culture. 

This is also a time of Turkish nationalism and a general popularization of the Turkic languages. Their capital was [Balasagun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasagun) (now destroyed), but the empire extended quite far west, into [Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand) and [Termez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termez).

## The Seljuk Empire (1037 – 1194)

The Seljuks were a Turkish people that originated near the Aral Sea, but expanded westward, taking Khorasan, and eventually going as far west as to conquer most of Anatolia.

Sanjar, The last ruler of the Seljuks favored monumental architecture, which turned out to be quite influential. [Sanjar’s tomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Ahmed_Sanjar) inspired the Duomo in Florence, [Isaakievskiy Sobor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral) in St. Petersburg, and the Capitol Building in Washington DC.

## Mongol Invasions (1219 - 1370)

Genghis Khan had no initial plan to conquer Khwarezm. He sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor. Hoping to unify Turks and Mongols under one nomadic banner ("people in felt tents”), Genghis Khan successfully conquered other nomadic peoples with relatively little bloodshed. To establish trade ties, Genghis sent a 500-man caravan, but the [governor of Otrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalchuq) had them arrested as spies and executed the entire party with the Shah’s support. 

The mongols were swift and ruthless in their revenge. Genghis Khan besieged Otrar in 1219, which resisted for five months and then fell. In the ensuing war, lasting less than two years, the Khwarezmid Empire was destroyed. The Mongols ruled


## Timurid Empire (1370 - 1507)

Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage, established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan.

By 1500, the Timurid empire was in decline due to infighting and pressure from Safavids and Ottomans. Babar, who claimed to be Genghis Khan’s descendant from father, and Timur’s descendant from mother, founded the Mughal empire which ruled over India. The three major Islamic empires split between them most of the Islamic world.

---- 

Many open questions and lingering threads remain, as well as directions for further exploration.

- I’d never heard of the epic poem Shahnameh, but it seems to differ from its Greek predecessors by being more inward looking and existential in nature. Worth a looksee if there are good translations.
- Read the Borges stories “The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv”, and “The Zahir”.
- Read something by Omar Khayyam. Maybe “The Rubaiyat”?
- The first poem in Lalla-Rookh (1817) by Thomas Moore is “The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan”.


Debt: The First 5000 Years
===
posted: March 6, 2020
rating: yes

“Debt” has been on my reading list for a long time. I once attempted the hard copy, but abandoned it quickly. It was mentioned again on a podcast by Saul Griffith, just as I was starting to get interested in the role of financing advances in innovation and progress. So I decided to give it another shot. This is the second edition of the book, updated after the financial crisis and after the 99% protest movement, which the author helped organize.

My overall feeling is that I learned a lot. The author, Graeber, is an anthropologist, and clearly erudite in a lot of adjacent fields as well. On the flip side, especially toward the end, the author’s personal beliefs became too prominent, at times transforming informative book into angry screed. Understandably, this detracted from the credibility of the book.

# Moral confusion around debt

Graeber starts many chapters of the book with awesome quotes. Here’s one: 

> If you owe the bank one hundred thousand, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank one hundred million, you own the bank.

Graeber describes how small-scale societies were based on mutual obligation, but as they grew and matured, debt became identified with money, became more transferrable from one person to another organization, to a yet larger one. Every step in that chain becomes less personal and more cruel. This may be the case, but it remains unclear to me that we can do better given the scale of our current societies.

Interestingly, many monetary systems are based on a small group of creditors giving out a large loan to the government that is then never repaid. This is true of Britain today, where the system nominally rests on a 1 million pound loan given by a few wealthy merchants many centuries ago. 

# Myth of barter

> For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong. – H. L. Mencken

In the afterword, Graeber reflects on the book and suggests that this chapter was his strongest. I agree: it is least rambling, most concrete and informative.

Barter is often imagined as a prehistoric mode of exchange by economists, as a precursor to money. A point out that a society that employed barter would require a two sided marketplace for each transaction (eg. I want shoes but have pencils, so need to find a shoe vendor that wants pencils specifically). The way out is to create a multilateral deal, or invent a medium of exchange (money). 

Except there are no known societies that employ barter internally. This is where Graeber’s anthropology background really comes in handily. Barter tends to be used between strangers, and typically as a single turn game, not a repeated one. 

In fact, the system that predates bullion wasn’t barter, but one of lending and ledgers. This was the dominant system in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Coins came later and were relatively unimportant for a long time.

# Wizard of oz

Apparently there is an economics reading of the Wizard of Oz: 

The Wicked Witches of the East and West are the coastal banking elites. The scarecrow is the prototypical farmer that gets screwed over but doesn't have the brains to address the underlying issue. The tin man is the proletarian worker who doesn't have the heart to side with the farmer. The lion is the political elite that doesn't have the courage to step out of rank. And they all march to the White House. The Emerald City is full of greenbacks, and many other gems refer to the proposed silver standard. All of it is a parable for William Jennings Brian's attempt at presidency and the first marches on the White House.

[Turns out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz) this isn’t Graeber’s invention.

# Primordial debt

Graeber explores the link between monetary debt and its predecessor, spiritual debt. Linguistically, the two concepts are deeply intertwined, most strikingly, German “gelt” and English “guilt” share a root (many other examples in book).

In a sense, you owe your existence to your parents, to society, and ultimately to God. But this is a debt you can never fully repay, although you must try anyway. Would you want to be square with your parents? If even possible, That implies you want nothing to do with them. Graeber’s take is that our relationship with cosmos is ultimately nothing like a commercial transaction. 

Here, we tend towards a more philosophical exploration. I enjoyed it:

> You are free from your debt to your ancestors when you become an ancestor; you are free from your debt to the sages when you become a sage, you are free from your debt to humanity when you act with humanity.

# Morality and economics

Communism as defined by “for each according to their needs, from each according to ability” is often practiced in smaller units, most notably the family, but not successfully in large scale societies.

Giving gifts to low status folks is fraught. You risk putting them down because there’s no way for them to pay you back. Conversely, giving gifts to superiors is fraught too. What can you really give to a king? It often leads to an expectation of such gifts and ultimately a tradition of tribute. Even to peers, gift giving can often be competitive. A fancy meal is met with a fancier meal.

At the same time, being slightly indebted to peers is a great way to build social cohesion. It feels like in western society many don't often feel indebted to other individuals, only to institutions. 

# History of honor

I struggled a bit with this chapter. Graeber drives at this idea that commerce is inherently based on violence, and is deeply rooted in slavery. This is where Graeber’s personal opinions start muddying the waters and the going gets tough for the first time. But he recovers and there’s more meat to be had.

# Money vs debt

Currency and more traditional debt and credit system arrangements came in and out of fashion over time. Money correlated to periods of war, because it was a time of mass mobilization, and having currency made it easier to pay soldiers. Credit systems flourished during periods of peace because they relied on trust networks to operate.

Many forms of currency existed before bullion (gold and silver). Cowrie shells were commonly used as money in China and other societies. Coins were first invented in Anatolia around 600 BCE by private citizens. Almost immediately they were adopted by the state. Same pattern repeats in other civilizations.

Coins and silver bars were mostly controlled by the rich, mostly stored in temples for religious purposes. But during times of conquest they were broken up and split up among warriors. Alexander the Great’s forces numbered 120,000 and had a daily wage of half a ton of silver! When he conquered, he coined new money from Assyrian reserves to pay his army. 

In India, Ashoka began his rule by conquering a neighbor, one of the last independent Indian states. He won the war but at a huge cost of hundreds of thousands of deaths, and vowed never to fight again. Coinage began to dwindle and was replaced by system of credits. 

Origins of interest are unknown but it was already happening by 2500 BCE in Mesopotamia! In the ancient world, a jubilee ritual of “breaking the tablets”, annulling all debts was done on a semi-regular basis. Jubilee was also demanded by peasant uprisings and granted by kings to mollify the people. 

# Axial age

(Interestingly, I am attempting to tackle a series of lectures on this topic. Haven’t made much progress yet, but this angle was specifically financial.)

Coined by Karl Jaspers, the Axial Age is a period around 800 BCE to 200 BCE marking a sudden beginning of reasoned inquiry. A wide range of positions in philosophy suddenly bloomed simultaneously in many places. Consider the lifespans of a few but diverse philosophers:

- Pythagoras - 570-495 BC
- Buddha - 563-483 BCE 
- Confucius - 551-479 BCE

Graeber extends his timespan to 600 CE, also including the “spiritual age” when Jesus and Mohamed and the Rabbinical tradition came into being. These were times of war, and transactions needed to be anonymous. Luckily, cash enabled this, and radically simplified all of the complex dynamics of trust-based systems. This led to the cold, hard, rational calculations and a profusion of new concepts: profit and loss.

Interestingly, with the advent of both impersonal greed and philosophical thought, religious spheres emerged, promulgating the idea that giving is better than taking, common to all religions of the axial age including Buddhism, Christianity, Islam.

# Middle Ages

The Middle Ages have a bad rap, but this is in large part because of the way that they are often presented in stark opposition to the renaissance, oftentimes by people living in the renaissance. The terms themselves are illuminating: a dark age turned into an era of rebirth!

True, cities like London and Paris which blossomed during the renaissance, were just remote outposts of the Roman Empire. When the empire fell, these cities returned to their prior obscurity. And even in these frontier towns, records were continued to be kept in Roman currencies. Meanwhile Rome and Constantinople flourished. 

Around the same time in India, Buddhism was flourishing and monasteries were funded by permanent trusts where the principal was lent out at a steep (15%) yearly interest rate. This was super surprising to me, since I’ve associated trusts like these with modernity.

In China, paper money emerged out of convenience in the 10th century. Rather than carrying strings of coins, which incidentally is why coins had a hole in the middle — to thread a string through for ease of carry, merchants traveling long distances preferred to carry less so developed a system of stamped paper notes. These were initially rejected by Chinese authorities, but being unable to control the practice adequately, they ultimately created a bureau to regulate the practice. A common pattern for China. 

## The Arab world

Graeber considers the Arab world at this time as basically western, an intellectual successor to the Greeks and Romans. Just like Middle Eastern Europe (then in shambles), the Arab world was attempting to synthesize the greek tradition with the prophets of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In stark contrast, the East was completely different. Super interesting 10,000 foot view.

Islam was super progressive for its time, addressing many of the injustices of the Axial Age. This included prohibitions against kidnapping into slavery, and also the hard stance against usury. But despite that, Islam had no issue with commerce in general, Mohamed himself at one point working as a merchant. Early Muslim states flourished economically and had banks that charged fees rather than compounding interest due to usury prohibitions. As a result, banking on its own wasn't a lucrative enough profession so many rich merchants doubled as banks for lesser brethren. Much of the economy was based on trust, and there was a real aversion to government interference in market mechanisms.

Apparently Adam Smith actually cites a lot of Persian economists. Smith’s pin factory is just a re-hashing of Al-Ghazali, who used the example of a needle factory to illustrate the same point. The pin doesn’t have a single maker, but twenty-five persons involved; these are all collaborating in the absence of a central planner. Adam Smith changed Al-Ghazali’s view that markets work because people like to co-operate to the view that market participants are only interested in selfish gain.  (Just how much of Smith was borrowed from Al-Ghazali and Al-Tusi is unclear from Graeber’s account, and he doesn’t make explicit claims here, but this is definitely one of those “this is why we can’t have nice things” with finger pointed at Americans.)

Meanwhile in Christendom, things were quite different. Markets came quite late and merchants as a profession were shunned by the church. All of Europe was a checkerboard of baronies and church holdings, with constant conflict reshaping the borders.

# The great capitalist empires

After a long shift away from bullion, the age of exploration coincided with a reversion to money     Partly due to the influx of gold and silver from the new world. 

During the enlightenment, an interesting trend: the dominance of bullion as a logical continuation of conservation laws coming from physics. “Newtonian economics” suggests that money cannot be created or destroyed, and that it needs an intrinsic anchor for its value. This wasn't really a consideration until the renaissance. 

Locke himself advocated for this Gold Standard, which led to financial troubles. Hobbes meanwhile promulgated the natural selfishness of people and necessity for social contacts. 

From this point onward, Graeber’s writing really becomes unbearable. His bias is too apparent.

> It is the secret scandal of capitalism that at no point was it organized primarily around free labor. The conquest of the Americas began with mass enslavement then gradually settled into debt peonage, African slavery and indentured service.

He does concede that the world is better today, but at a cost, making asinine comparisons between slavery and modern wage labor.

> There is no doubt that progress has produced an unprecedented improvement on the lives of billions over the last 250 years. But it's also unclear to me whether all of these improvements can be tied to capitalism.

# The beginning of something to be determined…

Nixon gets blamed for a lot of terrible things, including Vietnam. Is this fair, given that he inherited the war?

So many tropes! The US supposedly uses its military power to terrorize the world. US bonds are actually tribute, not loans. Many of his claims reek of edge-lordship, others come off sounding like conspiracy theories. China is apparently trying to turn the US into a client state. By giving tribute and lavish gifts to its clients, China has previously turned its nemeses into dependents. 

Yeah, okay, maybe. I’m torn!

Revenge of Analog

> “Digital’s overwhelming superiority initially renders analog alternatives worthless, but over time the perception of value shifts and when the honeymoon with a particular technology ends we are more readily able to judge its true merits and shortcomings.”

Very wordy, this is definitely a book to skim. The gist is that we’ve been overzealous about digitizing everything, and now analog is making a comeback in some areas. The book is a straightforward walkthrough of a few domains where this has been happening. The author does a good job of not sounding too crotchety, which is very easy to do in books like these. But this book has basically no insights. It’s more a summary of ideas that are all in the air.

**Notes**: The author presents a semi interesting study on Moleskine, colored by the character who helped cofound the company. There is indeed something that feels inherently good about taking paper notes. But not much insight beyond this. 

**Board games**: Turns out people are social! And the trend in video gaming is towards solo or online multiplayer, where you are fundamentally alone in a room. In contrast, with board games you're together with a bunch of friends and there's a lot more happening than just the game!

**Retail stores** are still important. No surprises again, that Apple and other maintain store presence and support. And bookstores are a good example of tactile scanning and easy previews. Conspicuously absent are libraries. 

**Work**: As far as I can tell this is where the author complains about tech displacing blue collar jobs. Sadly, even vinyl pressers are going to be automated if the market grows. You'll need CNC experience not operators. 

**Education**: Attempts to reform education have all been made with advents in new technology. And so far the traditional school classroom approach seems to be giving best results. This is a good reminder for me to ensure that my daughter ends up in a tech-free classroom. I found this quote to be oddly satisfying, and felt sorry for Thrun

> “Thrun predicted that MOOCs would be so distributive that in 50 years only ten institutions in the world would provide higher education and his would be one of them. Apparently a lesson about Icarus’s journey to the sun wasn't included on the Udacity syllabus.”

I like the idea that camp Walden doesn't allow any tech for its campers.

Overall, this book could easily be compressed into a 10 minute article. I found no new ideas in this book, just an occasional head nod: confirmation.


The Circle by Dave Eggers

The Circle is a thinly veiled parable for, well, Big Tech. At base this book suggests what can happen when high modernism goes too far in the 2010 version of tech. 

In some ways, the book feels dated. Even the most cynical observer today will agree that even Facebook is concerned with privacy, even if mainly to mitigate bad PR. Meanwhile the Circle is unabashedly techno utopian, extremely brash. I bet in 2014 when the book came out, it was culturally truer than it feels today. 

The Circle slogans are especially on the nose: “All that happens must be known”, “To heal we must know. To know we must share.” And PartiRank? Ha! “Secrets are lies, privacy is theft,  sharing is caring”. I think Eggers is going for the 1984 vibe, but it’s just a little over the top.

Mercer’s antler art commodification episode was pretty effective. The whole Instagram influencer business Mae fell into is prescient. I don't think influencers ousting celebrities was as much of a trend at the time of writing. 

Completing the circle feels analogous to building Communism, and a stark reminder that any ideology that tramples over your family and friends is probably bad news. 

I really enjoyed the twist in the end. It was so well done from the moment that “Mae knew what she had to do” to Mae’s supposed aversion of the apocalypse, to the ultimate reveal of whose side she ultimately landed on. Other than the twist, the plot was predictable but immensely addictive anyway. I breezed through this book, but it definitely felt like junk food. Big thanks Mr. P for sending it to me!


Fatherhood in Pieces by Chabon

Collection of essays, from wistful to banal. Nothing that special. But I liked a few vignettes: the one about how each kid costs you a book. And about how baseball is nostalgia, nicely tying three generations of men. 


Smoke and Mirrors by Neil Gaiman

posted: January 5, 2020
rating: no

I’ve never read Gaiman before, but his various works have frequented my to-read list. I wasn’t too thrilled by Sandman, but misattributed that feeling to the graphic novel medium. I abandoned this collection midway since the stories were often really boring or weirdly sexual. Even the best ones weren’t especially memorable or original. At first I optimistically found this unevenness appealing, like playing roulette. Half way through, I decided to cut my losses.

One of the better stories was hidden in the introduction, but was basically a riff on Picture of Dorian Gray. I also found “Troll”, “Chivalry”, “Queen of Knives” and “Shoggoth” to be entertaining but not memorable. Other stories were just bad, like “Goldfish Pool”, and “White Road”, and “Changes”.


The Right It (audio)

Cass suggested I check out The Right It by Alberto Savoia. This book is an ode to an idea: do as much as you can to vet an idea before committing a lot of time and energy on it. In other words, become as confident as possible in product-market fit before spending a lot of resources building even the first version. I strongly agree with the sentiment of the book, and have seen product and research teams fail for this exact reason. That said, it’s quite easy to condense into a substantially smaller format, and I might recommend that (if available) rather than reading the entire book.

Most new ventures fail. Savoia encourages founders to be brutally honest with themselves, make their hypotheses explicit and quantified, and then find clever ways to quickly and cheaply validate them. The steps are as follows:

1. Come up with an idea (eg. sell old sushi at a discount).
2. Develop a Market Engagement Hypothesis (eg. A lot of people who want to eat healthy and who like sushi can’t afford to eat it regularly, because sushi tends to be quite expensive. If we can find a way to make sushi as affordable as other fast food, a lot of fast-food patrons will choose sushi over less healthy alternatives.)
3. Quantify (2) with an X% of Y will do Z. (eg. At least 20% of packaged-sushi eaters will try Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)
4. Instantiate (3) with a specific, easily testable idea that gets people to put down money (eg. At least 20% of students buying packaged sushi at Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)
5. Actually run the experiment in (4) using a variety of techniques.
6. Collect your own data from the experiment in (5).
7. Compare the data with your hypothesis. If the results are close to the hypothesis, you are on the right track. If they are way off, might be time to throw in the towel.
8. If things look promising, do a few more runs of (4) - (7).
9. Ultimately make the decision whether to build it, drop it, or make changes to your plan based on what you learned.

Savoia describes a bunch of techniques that may be interesting to apply and riff on:

- Fake door technique: placing a facade of a product and seeing how people engage in it. Will they engage? (eg. A landing page for a website that asks for an email address)
- Pinnochio technique: pretending that a dummy object is actually real (eg. The Palm founder who pretended a block of wood was a PDA)
- Infiltrator technique: negotiate with a store to show your prototype on their shelves for a limited time.

I’ve seen focus groups and traditional user research fail in the exact way that Savoia describes: lack of skin in the game on the part of research participants.
