Tribe by Sebastian Junger
===

Junger disparages modern western life, and has a very fond attitude towards
traditional hunter-gatherer civilization.

"How do you become an adult in a society that doesn’t ask for sacrifice?" he
asks. "Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel
necessary," he asserts. Modernity provides affluence and safety, but it's
incompatible with freedom and equality. It's easy to spend a day in a modern
society while "surrounded by others and yet feel deeply, dangerously alone."
"As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide
tend to go up rather than down," Junger says. Modernity is fucked, Junger says,
without citing Rousseau. It just ain't natural. Without hardship, you don't
really **need** friends.

On the other hand, Tribal society, while not perfect, was, and let's be honest,
pretty fucking awesome! So awesome, in fact, that "a surprising number of
Americans—mostly men—wound up joining Indian society rather than staying in
their own." I found this surprising, and sadly, there was no citation. You don't
really need to be a hunter gatherer, though. You can just be from Soviet Russia
(this resonated): "Adversity often leads people to depend more on one another,
and that closeness can produce a kind of nostalgia for the hard times that even
civilians are susceptible to." Junger makes the distinction between family and
tribe explicitly: "Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same
as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything
collectively." I thought of the compania.

But even in shitty modernity, if the circumstances are dire enough, people can
still come together and act tribally:

- Male Youth: "They drive too fast, get into fights, haze each other, play
  sports, join fraternities, drink too much, and gamble with their lives in a
  million idiotic ways."

- War: "Emile Durkheim found that when European countries went to war, suicide
  rates dropped."

- Disaster: "social bonds were reinforced during disasters, and that people
  overwhelmingly devoted their energies toward the good of the community rather
  than just themselves."

In the US, soldiers risk a 20 percent chance of PTSD. "they return from wars
that are safer than those their fathers and grandfathers fought, and yet far
greater numbers of them wind up alienated and depressed. This is true even for
people who didn’t experience combat." Remarkably, in Israel, "Despite decades
of intermittent war, the Israel Defense Forces have by some measures a PTSD rate
as low as 1 percent."

Junger thinks that re-entry into American is so difficult because the military
is so close-knit, while modern life is so individualistic. "Soldiers experience
this tribal way of thinking at war, but when they come home they realize that
the tribe they were actually fighting for wasn’t their country, it was their
unit." Compounding the problem is the public's "thank you for your service,"
which rings hollow and reflects a distance from the war itself. Indeed, it's
an ocean away. Further, ever since Vietnam, much of the public has had a
principled disagreement with America's wars.

Junger wants to bring veterans and civilians closer together, to ease
re-integration. "More dignified might be to offer veterans all over the country
the use of their town hall every Veterans Day to speak freely about their
experience at war." Interesting start.

This struck a chord:

> The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but
frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral
extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing,
infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are
mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.

Nodding, I wondered: how disconnected am I? Why don't we go build a [house or a
tractor](https://www.opensourceecology.org/), or maybe learn the answers to some
of [these questions?](https://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/)


12 Rules for Life
===

One of my rules for life is: listicles are always clickbait, even in book form.
There is a balance to be found between order and chaos. These rules are
Petersons take on where that balance should be. I come at this with a dislike
for Peterson. I first heard him on a Sam Harris podcast and he came off as a
deliberate obscutantist. Also, the pronouns debate seems like a foolish hill to
die on. But when I. told me that he respected Peterson's ideas, I decided to
give the book ago. Spoiler alert: I got through about a third.

Tidbits I found interesting:

- Classical music is a good illustration of fat head distributions / Matthew's
  law / Price's law / Zipf's law. There are not many prominent composers and few
  of their pieces are performed on a regular basis.
- The Yin-yang symbol is actually about chaos and order, masculinity and
  femininity.

Most of Peterson's book is super annoying. Why the emphasis on the dominance
hierarchy? Sure it exists but is it the most fundamental thing about human
existence? After they're also other aspects to life that may be more important?
Peterson's is a classic zero sum framing of life, explicitly so in some places.
Petersons take on the snake as a primordial enemy that coevolved with humans is
a classic just so story. He ties it into Mary and Christ too, for good measure.
It's not credible, but his ability to spin a story is impressive. 

Peterson seems to be writing for an audience of very low self-esteem men. This
is a recipe book for escaping this rut, at worst by becoming a narcissistic
psychopath. By rule four, I'd had my fill and decided to cut my losses.


Building a Bridge to the 18th Century
===
posted: January 11, 2019
rating: no

Neil Postman has strong opinions:

- The 18th century was awesome. 
- Postmodernism is always, unequivocally bad. 
- You don't need typewriters or computers, paper and pen is good enough. 
- People are getting stupider and stupider. 
- Defeating straw man arguments is super fun. 

Postman cites many great thinkers in a way that is clearly erudite. However the
book is rather short and covers a lot of ground, making his name dropping quite
annoying. Rather than delivering deep points, Postman remains on the surface,
hinting at the existence of various philosophical ideas that he is intimately
familiar with. All this while struggling to structure a coherent narrative. 

I found the book mostly useless. It's a shallow summary of some stuff I already
knew, and set forth an exaggerated technological pessimism that I, to some
extent, share. In my most charitable view, Postman's over exaggerated positions
were intended to provoke thought for some hypothetical starry eyed silicon
valley entrepreneurial techno-optimist. Unfortunately, Postman's position is so
extreme and arguments so cliched, I found myself rooting for the other side. 


Infinite Planets

rating: yes

I've only just touched the tip of the Chinese Sci-Fi iceberg by reading [Three
Body Problem](/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/). So I picked up Infinite Planets, also translated by the same guy, Ken Liu.

Many of the stories were just too out there for me to fully enjoy. I'm not sure
if this is what's meant by "wuxia", but some had a sort of Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon feeling to them: extremely ephemeral, very unpredictable, hard to
understand. I really enjoyed many of the stories, though. Here are my favorites:

**The Fish of Lijiang**: an endearing vignette of fast paced life placed on
pause. Opposites attract in a science fiction cliche kind of way. 

**A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight**: where does reality end and really good
simulation begin?  Emotionally driven, powerful storytelling. Interesting blend
of Chinese folklore with speculative far future robotics/AI. 

**Night Journey of the Dragon Horse**: Memorable sketch of a post apocalypse in
which a sentient robotic dragon horse awakens from a long slumber. 

> "Time flows like a river, halting for no one. There is nothing in the world
that can outlast time itself." 

**Folding Beijing**: Great concept, compelling story. Interesting take on
automation. Also, this served as my introduction to the cynical [Philips
Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve). If I was to be picky, the
story felt a bit too directly critical of class divisions in modern China for my
taste.

**Taking Care of God**: a parable for aging, intergenerational
misunderstandings, but on a civilizational level. Memorable and bittersweet.
Loved the special relativity explanation for the religious vs. scientific
understanding of Earth's age. Has this been done before?
