The Story of Medieval England (audio)
===
posted: February 19, 2019
rating: yes

In the grand scheme of things, the western world today is pretty great. To what
do we owe its prosperity? I got curious about this and realized that the answer
probably lies in the broader traditions of the anglosphere. I'd heard of the
Magna Carta, and even seen it, but what was the big deal? Anyway, in my quest to
understand, I came across this great series of lectures covering English history
from around the 9th to the 15th century. Paxton does a great job of bringing
life to what I've felt to be an often dry and confusing time and place. The
narrative is mostly chronological, but once in a while, she pauses and explores
an area in depth to great effect. I enjoyed the many cross-references the
lecturer made throughout the lecture, her etymological diversions, and lively
depictions of heroes and villans, and also references to popular culture (movies
mostly).

# English chronology, roughly speaking 900 - 1500

(Imagine reading these in the style of Drunk History, I think it works best)

In the 8th century, England was split into seven kingdoms, each with its own
local lords. These kingdoms were loosely organized into counties called Shires,
each overseen by a Sheriff. This structure was originally military in nature,
each shire producing some quota of soldiers to fight on behalf of the local
lord. During this period, England was plagued by Danish invaders. Eventually,
all but Wessex came under Danish control, until the ruler of Wessex, Alfred the
Great, pushed back against the Danes and reconquered all of England. This didn't
last long though, and eventually the Danish and previous residents of England
melded into one people. However this was a troubled time, full of chaos and
internal strife and a lack of central control over the country. (TV show to
watch: The Last Kingdom)

**William the Conqueror** was a Norman (ie. descended from Norwegians who had
conquered and settled in the north of France). After a series of failed kings,
England's succession was unclear. William crossed the channel and burned farms,
cutting off the food supply to London, and sieging it. Eventually William
controlled both Normandy and England. He effectively suppressed rebellion and
got the nobles on his side. English society eventually subsumed Norman culture.

William's succession story is very colorful. Upon his gruesome death, his eldest
son took England, while his middle son took Normandy. The eldest went on the
first crusade, leaving England on lease to his brother. Meanwhile, Henry, the
youngest of the three, got nothing. After his middle brother died in a hunting
accident, Henry came to control both Normandy and England. Upon his return from
crusade, Henry imprisoned his oldest brother for the rest of his life (30
years?!). As king, **Henry I** made many changes, instituted the exchequer post
and appointed officials based on merit rather than birth.

Henry I's only son drowned in a drunken boat party. In his stead, Henry I
favored his daughter Matilda who was married off to the Holy Roman Emperor. But
queens weren't exactly a thing yet, so a succession dispute led to **King
Steven** coming to power. Steven was and not a very kingly man, and not a very
effective king. Anarchy and a civil war in erupted in England over Steven's
legitimacy, with Matilda's vying to get Henry, her son from her second
marriage onto the throne. 

Eventually she succeeded, and **Henry II**'s reign was focused on mending the
damage done by the civil war, reuniting England and Normandy, and restoring it
to grandpa William's glory. Henry II married Eleanor of Acquitaine, further
expanding his empire into France. Sadly his reign was undone by a conflict with
Thomas Beckett, formerly his right hand man, but now the archbishop of
Canterbury. When he had Beckett killed for disobedience, he became deeply
unpopular and Becket was canonized as a saint. (Movie: Beckett)

Henry II was succeeded by his son Richard I, know as **Richard the Lionheart**.
He was extremely popular for his military prowess, as well as patronage of arts
and literature, especially the new genre of Legends of King Arthur, and Courtly
Love. He went on the third pilgrimage, by which point Saladin had already
reconquered Jerusalem. But Richard succeeded in defeating Saladin at Acco, which
remained European controlled for a century. 

Upon Richard's death, he was succeeded by brother John. **King John** was not a
good king, cruel, and petulant. John managed to lose all of England's holdings
in France. He alienated his barons to such a degree that many of them banded
together to impose a great charter (Magna Carta) on John, designed to curtail
his power. This included trial by a jury of peers, and also no extraordinary
taxation without cause. John got Pope Innocent to repudiate the Magna Carta. and
eventually many English lords sided with the French, backing prince Louis as the
English king. John's son Henry succeeded him, and managed to best Louis and
win support of the English nobles with the help of William Marshall. 

Under **Henry III**, the baronial conflicts continued. The Magna Carta was
reinstated, but still Henry III and his barons had many disagreements.
Especially on the foreign policy front, Henry III had many strange and foolish
ideas, attempting to reconquer Poitu in France, to place his brother on the
Sicilian throne, and to prevent lords from going on crusade. Every time the king
asked for a concession, the barons would trade it for more political power.
Eventually this led to the Treaty of Oxford, which extended the Magna Carta,
giving barons more power to appoint councils and administrators to effectively
run the country. Henry accepts the treaty but then reneged with the support of
an invited arbitrator St. Louis, King of France. The barons rebelled and forced
his hand. Simon de Montfort, leader of the baronial revolt also formalized the
structure of the parliament (from parle) which was formerly entirely informally
called by the king when he wanted to raise money. Now the parliament would meet
regularly, and be composed of 2 knights from each shire, and 2 members from
specific boroughs, elected locally. This structure clearly precedes that of The
House.

**Edward I**, Henry III's son, succeeded him, to a collective baronial relief.
He was much more level headed than his father. Edward went on crusade, just like
the legendary and much loved Richard I. Edward passed many reforms to the common
law. In my books, he is ultimately a villan. He passed an Edict which banned
Jews from England, which lasted for the next 350 years, until Cromwell allowed
their return in the 17th century. In the grand scheme, this may be a greater
travesty than the Spanish Inquisition!

**Edward II** succeeded his well loved father, and had an unpopular reign. He
was accused of homosexuality because of his closeness with his nearest advisor,
Galston. The barons hated this so much, they successfully expelled Galston to
France five times, and eventually murdered him. The barons attempted to rise up
against the king, but their efforts were quashed. The rebellion's leader was
murdered as retribution without a trial, which didn't help Ed's popularity. Also
Edward II suffered humiliating defeat at the hands of Robert the Bruce in
Scotland. Ultimately he was deposed by his barons and placed in prison, where he
died, possibly by being disemboweled as punishment for his lifestyle choices.
His wife allied herself with the Barons, and succeeded in getting their son Ed
III to the throne.

**Edward III** started his career as king under the thumb of his mother and her
lover. When he grew old enough, Ed III took over in a coup and took the reigns.
For a while he was also a legitimate heir to the French throne through his
mother's line. Ultimately he conquered a bunch of French lands, including Calais
in the north which was strategically important because it was the opposing port
to Dover and constituted the shortest crossing of the channel. Rodin's famous
sculpture of the six nobleman of Calais depicts a an event that actually
happened where Edward III picked out six noblemen of Calais to be hung for their
subordination, but conceded when his pregnant wife begged for mercy. Generally a
very successful Ed III is remembered fondly in contrast to his father.

To finance the Hundred Years War against France, Edward III introduced a tax
that affected everyone, even the poorest. Previously taxes only applied to
people that owned goods, effectively a wealth tax. This new head tax also rose
over time. Also, papal patronage meant the pope instated high ranking clergy
from Rome, barring local clergy. This is also the period of the Avignon
"Babylonian captivity", when popes moved from Rome to southern France. During
this Great Schism, there were sometimes 3 popes. I'd never heard of John
Wycliffe and his followers (known as Lollards) but he was a sort of proto-Martin
Luther, advocating similar reforms to Christian orthodoxy such as a direct
relationship with God and redistribution of church-owned land. He even produced
the Bible translated into vernacular English. This economic and clerical
dissatisfaction led to the Peasant Revolt of 1381, which was the first popular
(as opposed to Baronial) rebellion. It was eventually quelled but did
demonstrate that the king increasingly had to listen to the people. The head tax
was abolished. 

**Richard II** was the grandson of Edward III. Richard's reign was completely
dominated by what is called the Merciless Parliament, which strove to further
curtail the power of the king. In retaliation Richard the second banished many
of its members and denied inheritance to several opposing Lords. Eventually he
was deposed by a new parliament and died in a prison cell in 1400. He was
succeeded by Henry Bolingbrook, who came to reign as **Henry IV**.  He was the first
Lancaster of a long dynasty, eventually leading to the Tudors. His reign was
short, succeeded by his son **Henry V**. 

Henry V's reign was highlighted by successful conquest in France during the
Hundred Years War, most notably, in the battle of Agincourt. This was largely
due to internal divisions in France, but it made Henry V a popular king. His son
and successor **Henry VI** managed to lose all of the English territories in
France.  By then, France was united again, and Henry VI had little interest in
ruling was mentally unstable. The only English territory in France that remained
was Calais, and England held it for the next century. 

Henry VI's death led to a succession dispute between two houses: Lancaster (red
rose) and York (white rose), called the War of the Roses. At first York had the
upper hand. Its leader Ed IV held the reigns until his death, and was succeeded
by his son Edward V, a 12-year-old boy at the time. But his reign did not last
long. Vying for power, Ed V's uncle Richard, invented a lie saying that Ed was a
bastard. This led to a successful propaganda campaign in which Richard III
successfully usurped the throne. But it backfired as most people could see
through the lie. Richard III likely executed his young rivals in the Tower of
London, and he was reviled by the people, often depicted as a hunchback and of
short statue in retrospect. 

**Henry Tudor** was part of the Lancaster faction, and had a claim to the
throne.  His first attempt to take over was thwarted by King Richard III, and he
escaped to Bretagne in France. From there, he eventually amassed an army and met
Richard III in battle. Due to his unpopularity, Richard's armies did not obey
him at a critical moment. Henry Tudor was victorious, the War of the roses was
Won by the Lancasters, and thus begins the Tudor lineage, a long period of
English stability. To cement his position and end the civil war definitively,
Henry VII married Elizabeth of York. He and his son Henry VIII then
systematically eliminated all of the pretenders to the throne, and paved the way
for English supremacy during the Renaissance. 

# Crazy etymological stuff

- The name Easter comes from the pagan holiday Eostre. The apple does not fall
  far from the tree. 
- To liquidate comes from melting of coins and other metallic valuables. Obvious
  in retrospect, never thought of it.
- Tolkien's Shire and modern police Sheriffs both trace back to medieval
  England.
- A farthing comes from the word "fourth", because it's value is 1/4 of a penny.
- The title Earl comes from Ealdorman, rooted in "elder". Crazy!
- Chivalry comes from the French word for horse, cheval. Another obvious in
  retrospect case.
- Heraldry is the study of coats of arms. The connection to newspapers named The
  Herald is present but convoluted.
- The notion of bearing arms used to mean that you had a coat of arms, as an
  indication of status. This sure has morphed over time for sure!

# Interesting thoughts and insights

It remains unclear to me what role Thanes played in 9th century England. Did
they have several shires in their control?

The Domesday book is an impressively early systematic attempt to survey all of
England. It was conducted by William the Conqueror in 1080s. Damn impressive for
the time. 

Apparently the switch from oxen to horses for agriculture happened from the 11th
to 13th centuries, with a surge in commerce. Farmers were no longer subsisting,
but producing extra, which would be sold at markets and fairs. Oxen are stronger
than horses, but do not make very good riding animals. A second order effect of
this switch was a change in the shape of farming fields. Previously, plots were
long and narrow since oxen were very hard to turn. Now plots were much more
variable in shape.

Paxton has a really great discussion on chivalry. This horse culture apparently
was the delineating line between yeomen and elites. Tournaments began as multi
person melee brawls and eventually morphed into formal affairs that we think of
today, with jousting. This tracks the evolution of knights, which were
originally hired mercenaries but ultimately became an upper class, sharing the
table with earls and kings. This upward mobility of knights was greatly enabled
by the church, when it condoned violence in the name of the crusades. Finally,
the culture of heroism and going on crusades had much cache. Vividly, Paxton
retells the story of a blind king of Bohemia charging into battle flanked by his
two companions. He wanted glory in death and found it in Calais. 

Written English temporarily died after the Norman conquest, and was supplanted
by French. This lasted for a while, as the civic elite favored French and the
religious elite favored Latin. Eventually written English made a big return with
prominent works written in it including the Canterbury Tales, which interesting
are about a group of pilgrims making their way to see the Tomb of Thomas
Beckett. (Interestingly, French remained the Lingua Franca of Europe for a
while, with Russia and other latecomers clearly falling under French influence
as late as the 19th century.)

I think roughly speaking, society was ordered like this: serf (indentured
servant), then yeoman (small landowner), then gentry (artisans, merchants), then
knight, lord, and king. Rankings among the clergy still elude me, but an
interesting topic for future reading.

I was struck that many historical "events" lasted much longer than I would have
guessed. The three crusades spanned 3 centuries. The Black Plague ebbed and
flowed also over 3 centuries. This is of course easy to see in retrospect, but
it made me wonder what sorts of 3-century long historical events people of 2500
will remember about us?



Real Estate and Cash Flow

"What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow... And 36 Other
Key Financial Measures, Updated Edition"... What a title!

To be honest, I'm kind of embarrassed to post this here, especially so soon
after The New Father. But, I'll admit, I'm a bit spooked by the markets lately.
While indexing has worked well so far, it feels risky, and I'd probably be wise
to diversity. Hence this book.

The book makes two things crystal clear: 

1. "Investors don’t decide to buy properties; they decide to buy the income
   streams of the properties."
2. The importance of discount rate in doing these various calculations, or as
   the author usually descibes it, "the time value of money".

Also, I liked the up-front breakdown of all of the ways in which being a
landlord may be profitable:

1. Cash flow: "You expect to collect money, mainly in the form of rent."
2. Amortization: "You expect to spend money to pay for the operating expenses
   and the loans against the property."
3. Tax shelter: "When you’re done for the year, you hope to have a surplus and
   to keep as much of it as you can in your own pocket and out of the hands of
   the tax collector."
4. Appreciation: "Perhaps someday you can also sell the property at a handsome
   profit."

If I end up attempting to purchase a real estate investment, the book will serve
as a good reference for calculating various terms of the industry (eg. APOD, Cap
rate, CFAT, etc). Honestly, this is really boring stuff, and pretty
straightforward from a calculation perspective. During the case studies
especially, the author meticulously grinds through the numbers, and I could feel
my eyes glazing over.

Oh, before I end this topic, here is an anti-recommendation to a similarly
titled, but much dumber "Rental Property Investing: how to invest in profitable
properties to rent and derive maximum profit from them". Complete drivel. Skip
it.

My daughter Elichka is a year old! She's the best, let me show you a picture?
Actually no. Not on the internet.

This book was a trusty reference for me when things got a bit dicey. Rather
than reading daddy or mommy blogs (urgh), a quick look at the relevant age was
sometimes helpful in calming the nerves. I'd recommend it to a new father.


Tribe by Sebastian Junger
===
posted: January 18, 2019
rating: yes

Junger disparages modern western life, and has a very fond attitude towards
traditional hunter-gatherer civilization.

"How do you become an adult in a society that doesn’t ask for sacrifice?" he
asks. "Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel
necessary," he asserts. Modernity provides affluence and safety, but it's
incompatible with freedom and equality. It's easy to spend a day in a modern
society while "surrounded by others and yet feel deeply, dangerously alone."
"As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide
tend to go up rather than down," Junger says. Modernity is fucked, Junger says,
without citing Rousseau. It just ain't natural. Without hardship, you don't
really **need** friends.

On the other hand, Tribal society, while not perfect, was, and let's be honest,
pretty fucking awesome! So awesome, in fact, that "a surprising number of
Americans—mostly men—wound up joining Indian society rather than staying in
their own." I found this surprising, and sadly, there was no citation. You don't
really need to be a hunter gatherer, though. You can just be from Soviet Russia
(this resonated): "Adversity often leads people to depend more on one another,
and that closeness can produce a kind of nostalgia for the hard times that even
civilians are susceptible to." Junger makes the distinction between family and
tribe explicitly: "Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same
as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything
collectively." I thought of the compania.

But even in shitty modernity, if the circumstances are dire enough, people can
still come together and act tribally:

- Male Youth: "They drive too fast, get into fights, haze each other, play
  sports, join fraternities, drink too much, and gamble with their lives in a
  million idiotic ways."

- War: "Emile Durkheim found that when European countries went to war, suicide
  rates dropped."

- Disaster: "social bonds were reinforced during disasters, and that people
  overwhelmingly devoted their energies toward the good of the community rather
  than just themselves."

In the US, soldiers risk a 20 percent chance of PTSD. "they return from wars
that are safer than those their fathers and grandfathers fought, and yet far
greater numbers of them wind up alienated and depressed. This is true even for
people who didn’t experience combat." Remarkably, in Israel, "Despite decades
of intermittent war, the Israel Defense Forces have by some measures a PTSD rate
as low as 1 percent."

Junger thinks that re-entry into American is so difficult because the military
is so close-knit, while modern life is so individualistic. "Soldiers experience
this tribal way of thinking at war, but when they come home they realize that
the tribe they were actually fighting for wasn’t their country, it was their
unit." Compounding the problem is the public's "thank you for your service,"
which rings hollow and reflects a distance from the war itself. Indeed, it's
an ocean away. Further, ever since Vietnam, much of the public has had a
principled disagreement with America's wars.

Junger wants to bring veterans and civilians closer together, to ease
re-integration. "More dignified might be to offer veterans all over the country
the use of their town hall every Veterans Day to speak freely about their
experience at war." Interesting start.

This struck a chord:

> The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but
frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral
extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing,
infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are
mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.

Nodding, I wondered: how disconnected am I? Why don't we go build a [house or a
tractor](https://www.opensourceecology.org/), or maybe learn the answers to some
of [these questions?](https://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/)


12 Rules for Life
===
posted: January 17, 2019
rating: no

One of my rules for life is: listicles are always clickbait, even in book form.
There is a balance to be found between order and chaos. These rules are
Petersons take on where that balance should be. I come at this with a dislike
for Peterson. I first heard him on a Sam Harris podcast and he came off as a
deliberate obscutantist. Also, the pronouns debate seems like a foolish hill to
die on. But when I. told me that he respected Peterson's ideas, I decided to
give the book ago. Spoiler alert: I got through about a third.

Tidbits I found interesting:

- Classical music is a good illustration of fat head distributions / Matthew's
  law / Price's law / Zipf's law. There are not many prominent composers and few
  of their pieces are performed on a regular basis.
- The Yin-yang symbol is actually about chaos and order, masculinity and
  femininity.

Most of Peterson's book is super annoying. Why the emphasis on the dominance
hierarchy? Sure it exists but is it the most fundamental thing about human
existence? After they're also other aspects to life that may be more important?
Peterson's is a classic zero sum framing of life, explicitly so in some places.
Petersons take on the snake as a primordial enemy that coevolved with humans is
a classic just so story. He ties it into Mary and Christ too, for good measure.
It's not credible, but his ability to spin a story is impressive. 

Peterson seems to be writing for an audience of very low self-esteem men. This
is a recipe book for escaping this rut, at worst by becoming a narcissistic
psychopath. By rule four, I'd had my fill and decided to cut my losses.


Building a Bridge to the 18th Century
===
posted: January 11, 2019
rating: no

Neil Postman has strong opinions:

- The 18th century was awesome. 
- Postmodernism is always, unequivocally bad. 
- You don't need typewriters or computers, paper and pen is good enough. 
- People are getting stupider and stupider. 
- Defeating straw man arguments is super fun. 

Postman cites many great thinkers in a way that is clearly erudite. However the
book is rather short and covers a lot of ground, making his name dropping quite
annoying. Rather than delivering deep points, Postman remains on the surface,
hinting at the existence of various philosophical ideas that he is intimately
familiar with. All this while struggling to structure a coherent narrative. 

I found the book mostly useless. It's a shallow summary of some stuff I already
knew, and set forth an exaggerated technological pessimism that I, to some
extent, share. In my most charitable view, Postman's over exaggerated positions
were intended to provoke thought for some hypothetical starry eyed silicon
valley entrepreneurial techno-optimist. Unfortunately, Postman's position is so
extreme and arguments so cliched, I found myself rooting for the other side. 


Infinite Planets

posted: January 2, 2019
rating: yes

I've only just touched the tip of the Chinese Sci-Fi iceberg by reading [Three
Body Problem](/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/). So I picked up Infinite Planets, also translated by the same guy, Ken Liu.

Many of the stories were just too out there for me to fully enjoy. I'm not sure
if this is what's meant by "wuxia", but some had a sort of Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon feeling to them: extremely ephemeral, very unpredictable, hard to
understand. I really enjoyed many of the stories, though. Here are my favorites:

**The Fish of Lijiang**: an endearing vignette of fast paced life placed on
pause. Opposites attract in a science fiction cliche kind of way. 

**A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight**: where does reality end and really good
simulation begin?  Emotionally driven, powerful storytelling. Interesting blend
of Chinese folklore with speculative far future robotics/AI. 

**Night Journey of the Dragon Horse**: Memorable sketch of a post apocalypse in
which a sentient robotic dragon horse awakens from a long slumber. 

> "Time flows like a river, halting for no one. There is nothing in the world
that can outlast time itself." 

**Folding Beijing**: Great concept, compelling story. Interesting take on
automation. Also, this served as my introduction to the cynical [Philips
Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve). If I was to be picky, the
story felt a bit too directly critical of class divisions in modern China for my
taste.

**Taking Care of God**: a parable for aging, intergenerational
misunderstandings, but on a civilizational level. Memorable and bittersweet.
Loved the special relativity explanation for the religious vs. scientific
understanding of Earth's age. Has this been done before?
