Building a Bridge to the 18th Century

posted: January 11, 2019
rating: no

Neil Postman has strong opinions:

- The 18th century was awesome. 
- Postmodernism is always, unequivocally bad. 
- You don't need typewriters or computers, paper and pen is good enough. 
- People are getting stupider and stupider. 
- Defeating straw man arguments is super fun. 

Postman cites many great thinkers in a way that is clearly erudite. However the
book is rather short and covers a lot of ground, making his name dropping quite
annoying. Rather than delivering deep points, Postman remains on the surface,
hinting at the existence of various philosophical ideas that he is intimately
familiar with. All this while struggling to structure a coherent narrative. 

I found the book mostly useless. It's a shallow summary of some stuff I already
knew, and set forth an exaggerated technological pessimism that I, to some
extent, share. In my most charitable view, Postman's over exaggerated positions
were intended to provoke thought for some hypothetical starry eyed silicon
valley entrepreneurial techno-optimist. Unfortunately, Postman's position is so
extreme and arguments so cliched, I found myself rooting for the other side. 


Infinite Planets

I've only just touched the tip of the Chinese Sci-Fi iceberg by reading [Three
Body Problem](/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/). So I picked up Infinite Planets, also translated by the same guy, Ken Liu.

Many of the stories were just too out there for me to fully enjoy. I'm not sure
if this is what's meant by "wuxia", but some had a sort of Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon feeling to them: extremely ephemeral, very unpredictable, hard to
understand. I really enjoyed many of the stories, though. Here are my favorites:

**The Fish of Lijiang**: an endearing vignette of fast paced life placed on
pause. Opposites attract in a science fiction cliche kind of way. 

**A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight**: where does reality end and really good
simulation begin?  Emotionally driven, powerful storytelling. Interesting blend
of Chinese folklore with speculative far future robotics/AI. 

**Night Journey of the Dragon Horse**: Memorable sketch of a post apocalypse in
which a sentient robotic dragon horse awakens from a long slumber. 

> "Time flows like a river, halting for no one. There is nothing in the world
that can outlast time itself." 

**Folding Beijing**: Great concept, compelling story. Interesting take on
automation. Also, this served as my introduction to the cynical [Philips
Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve). If I was to be picky, the
story felt a bit too directly critical of class divisions in modern China for my
taste.

**Taking Care of God**: a parable for aging, intergenerational
misunderstandings, but on a civilizational level. Memorable and bittersweet.
Loved the special relativity explanation for the religious vs. scientific
understanding of Earth's age. Has this been done before?
