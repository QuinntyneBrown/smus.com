Timefulness by Marcia Bjornerud

Rating: yes

Most people, myself included, lack a scientific foundation for understanding complex issues like climate change. As a result, discourse around the issue is split into either denial and panic. Both are negative, paralyzing emotions.  I’d rather find a constructive middle way. 

Backpacking together through the canyons of the Pariah, I watched the landscape with a sense of heightened curiosity. Dad and I had front row seats to observe nature’s processes at work: rivers carving deeper and deeper into slot canyons, erosion’s cleaver splitting gigantic sandstone faces in twain. In a place like the Vermillion Cliffs, you can really feel the Earth’s sovereignty. We are merely ants. 

How might we bring this feeling of scientific curiosity and majestic awe to more people?

I heard the author’s Long Now talk and thought she did an excellent job. 

---- 

Here’s an interesting analogy to kick the book off:

- Microscope: small things
- Telescope: far away things
- Geology: long ago things

All in all the book is short and merely serves to whet the appetite. The author starts with a historical background, goes on to explain some of the science and provide a quick chronology of the Earth (a condensation of her already condensed course), and ends with a discussion about climate change and the future. It’s quite dense in some sections, especially where the author specific processes such as the Carbon cycle.

Geology is a new science. Our fundamental understanding of plate tectonics can be traced to just 1965. It’s also a cross-disciplinary science featuring "whole brain thinking" and leaning heavily on visualization. Indeed, there’s a whole world of [geology visualization software][1] which I have yet to explore. 

High level overview of earth's life as we know today.

- Mesozoic: 252 - 66 ma
- Paleozoic: 541 - 252 ma
- Precambrian: 4600 - 541 ma

TODO: finish this up.

Yes Brain by Siegel and Bryson
===
posted: September 20, 2019
rating: no

Yes Brain is a parenting book. This immediately means several things:

- It’s extremely repetitive.
- It sports branding. “Yes Brain™ – good. No Brain – bad”. 
- This is strictly necessary because parents are chronically sleep deprived and can’t focus for more than five minutes.

Here’s the overall framework within which the book operates:

Children are born with a fully developed “downstairs brain” (roughly aka limbic system, lizard brain, system one), which controls involuntary response. As they grow, they are developing their “upstairs brain” (cortex, system two), in charge of higher level thought. So as children develop, many of their reactions are driven by system one. The parent’s role is to help develop system two. This means going from a predominantly reactive stimulus-response mode to “response flexibility”: being able to choose how to respond to a stimulus.

I find this to be a useful framework in general. All but the most enlightened meditators could use a bit more response flexibility. The most useful parts of this book describe strategies for explaining what this might look like to young children. Unfortunately for me, most examples in the book focus on 5, 8, 13 year olds. One of the most approachable frameworks is based on colors, which my toddler has yet to learn. So I think we have a prerequisite to fill first!

The green zone is a state where response flexibility is maximized. The red zone is a tantrum or lack of control. The blue zone is withdrawal after a pattern of bad feedback. The parental role is to expand the green zone, make children spent more time there, and make returning to green faster. The authors suggest teaching the model to the kids as well to be able to talk about it, and spend some time discussing what that would look like through fairly insightful comics.

Other things I liked included some Stoically inspired advice:

- There’s an explicit discussion of walking children through tough times without coddling them. In the dismal language of the authors, it’s about finding the “goldilocks balance” between “pushin’” and “cushin’”.
- Reframing when kids misbehave. It may be useful to treat this as a form of communication. See it as a call for help rather than them acting out and making things hard for you.
- Present difficult situations as “which struggle do you prefer?”. Seems handy to reframe pain as a learning experience.
- Try on the outside view to learn to get some emotional distance from the problem at hand. They have a great analogy  of being a player player vs. being a spectator.
- For empathy, it’s useful to practice in children’s books: What is the person feeling right now?

Random things I disliked:

- The authors reject any external measuring sticks. A lot of the book emphasized process over results to such an extreme that it conflates extrinsic plenty with intrinsic poverty. In my mind, you should aim for both.
- Let’s sprinkle in **neuroscience** to make the book sound more scientistic! Name-dropping the connectome adds nothing, but makes me more annoyed.
- Conveniently, the authors provide a “Yes Brain Refrigerator Sheet”, a built-in summary of the book. Sadly it is very bad and doesn’t include the actual good parts of the book.

The good parts of this book provide some interesting strategies for teaching stoicism and mindfulness to young children. Perhaps in a few years, I’ll revisit one of its many clones.


Diamond Age by Stephenson (audio)
===
posted: September 5, 2019
rating: yes

It's official: I'm on a science fiction kick! It's been a while since I
read Stephenson. It's not that I don't like reading long books, I do. It's just
a question of bang for the buck. Diamond Age stood out because of the
Illustrated Primer, which is relevant to my interests in education, and
Young Ladies, one of which I have the pleasure to be raising. And it wasn't too
long.

Overall, I enjoyed it. The world building was especially compelling: a few
hundred years into the future, an earthbound humanity has balkanized into
tribes. These are not geographically bound but global, with enclaves in every
major city. This strikes me as both interesting as a concept, and plausible as a
way for our already fragile multiculturalism to unravel more fully. 

As Diamond Age is a Stephenson book, there are many concrete tech-related ideas
that are worth mentioning.

- Matter Compiler - a way to synthesize matter of any kind. At seemingly
  arbitrarily large scales if you have the funds. (Incidentally, I excitedly
  mentioned Matter Compilers in a recent tweet, comparing 3D printing to Matter
  Compilers and got roasted for it by a UW professor!)

- Mites - nano-technological robots that can do almost anything. Very much
  indistinguishable from magic.

- Neo-Victorians - a tribe living with Victorian ideals loyal to some vestigual
  British monarchy headed by Queen Victoria II: hierarchy, order, aristocracy.
  They have a social structure and dukes most of which graduate from careers as
  successful entrepreneurs.

- The Illustrated Primer - an interactive book designed for a Neo-Victorian
  princess to have an “interesting” childhood so that she grows up to make a
  dent on the world. The Primer is both adaptive and personalized, and is at the
  core of Diamond Age.

- Ractors - Remote Actors that are instrumented in a way that allows them to do
  a very advanced form of voice and motion capture.

- Cheveleens: electromechanical horse-robots often used by Neo-Victorians as
  transportation. 

For a nearly 30 year old book, I'm surprised at how well it's aged. Written in
1996, most aspects come off as very modern, alluding to a distributed web and
distributed ledgers. Brain-computer interfaces are pervasive in the story, and
continue to remain a speculative and illusive area of research.  Some of the
tech has aged poorly, but this is more endearing than annoying. Data is stored
on tape drives, large amounts of it is expressed in gigabytes.

If I was to edit Diamond Age, I'd skip the computer science education parts.
Nell's Illustrated Primer adventures in Castle Turing rely on thinly veiled
analogies that aren't especially insightful.  Wordy passages compare zeros and
ones to two sorts of links in a chain. Stephenson literally explains ASCII
codes. To someone that knows these concepts well, it's boring. To someone that
doesn't, I think it would be boring too. I was distracted by the endless
metaphors between orgies and distributed computing -- typical Stephenson.
Group sex is considerably more entertaining to read and write about than
networking.

Overall, the book felt stronger viewed as a world building exercise rather
than a coherent work of fiction. This despite the some really colorful
characters and an engaging story overall. Some of my favorites were Lord
Finkel-McGraw, Carl Hollywood, Judge Fang, and Dr. X, and the narrator's
entertaining delivery helped. Other major characters start off interesting, but
transform into nagging loose ends: what happened to Nell's guardian Constable
Moore? And to her friends Elizabeth and Fiona?

The plot jumps in ways that force the reader to fill in the gaps, and the
traverse between Nell's reality and the world of the Illustrated Primer can be
disorienting. But if memory serves, this is not unlike Stephenson's other books.
Snow Crash comes to mind. The Drummers, the First Distributed
Republic and other crypto-adjacent tribes were the most mysterious and difficult
to understand elements of the story. Not unlike real life, I might add! 

The ending is ambiguous but still satisfying. I can't help but wonder: was the
primer comissioned deliberately to subvert the world order by Finkel-McGraw?



Hyperion by Dan Simmons (audio)
===
posted: August 4, 2019
rating: yes

I attempted Hyperion a decade or so ago, but couldn't get into it. If I recall,
I found the introduction obscure and difficult to follow and gave up.
However, after many of my friends raved about it, I gave it another shot, and
really loved it.

Set in a far, post-Earth, space-faring future, the Hyperion universe is really
compelling. A core group of planets is run by a giant corporation with
relatively little opposition from rebellious factions. Interstellar FTL travel
is commonplace. Everyone seems to be basically human, but there are really fun
variations. I especially enjoyed the templars and their treeships, giant living,
space-traveling trees like Yggdrasil, which initially housed the party bound for
Hyperion.

The book itself unfolds as a thrilling mystery set in this wonderful universe.
Narratively, it's modeled after the Canterbury Tales. A rag-tag group of
pilgrims each tells his story en-route to their destination. The stories are the
best part. Each one stands on its own, and the fact that they are all set in the
same universe, and are all about one planet make it feel like you're hearing
each blind man's description of the elephant in turn.

All of the stories are about Hyperion and the Shrike, but more importantly, are
very emotionally moving. I found the Catholic priest storyline to be totally
gut-wrenching, but that was just the beginning. My favorite by far was Saul
Weintraub's daughter Rachel, aging backwards. This might be my personal bias: I
too am the Jewish father of a young daughter. But more likely, it's incredibly
well written. Sauls struggles with God and the problem of theodicy in a way that
is far more heartfelt than any theoretical treatise on the subject. The final
story told by the Consul about his grandfather Merin's is also great, and the
conversation with dolphins "scene" is incredible. There is so much more there,
though: romantic implications of time dilation, the chronological complexity in
the narrative, flashbacks and flashes forward are masterfully written. Kassad's
and Silenius' stories are also excellent and stand on their own, although less
compelling than the aforementioned in my opinion. Lamia's tale was emotionally
weaker and leaned too heavily on AI mumbo jumbo.

Each sub-story is so diverse, and spawns so many questions, it feels nearly
impossible to integrate into a final product. I shouldn't be surprised at the
cliffhanger ending. I did find that the book lost some steam towards the
very end, but this is excusable given that Hyperion is the first of four highly
acclaimed books. Whether or not the series itself wraps up coherently, the way
to read this book is to enjoy the Hyperion universe and each of the pilgrim's
tales for their brilliance in their own right.



Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery
===
posted: July 10, 2019
rating: yes

Asimov attempts to create a real-world technology chronology. This reminds me of
the tech trees found in strategy games like Civilization. This encyclopedic tome
is not a book you would normally read cover to cover, and I'll be honest: I'm
only less than a quarter of the way through. I read from the beginning of time
to 1519 (500a), just to get a feeling for the book, and really learned a lot.
Some surprising things about early human history:

- Dizzying array of horse-related inventions: metal stirrups giving more
  stability to the rider, iron horseshoes to let horses travel further,
  horse collars to increase pulling capacity by 5x.
- The perfect plow, called the Moldboard or Turnplow had a vertical knife-blade
  that cut deep into the earth. Useful for damp, moist ground, led to increase
  in carrying capacity.
- Telling time, from water clocks to more accurate weight-powered
  mechanical clocks, to spring powered watches that could be much smaller.

But also, let me nitpick a bit. In addition to inventions, the author spends an
inordinate amount of time on geographic discoveries, which feels disconnected
from the rest of the narrative.  Some other "discoveries" are hard to square
with the rest of the content, such as "the rational interpretation of dreams",
first discovered? invented? in 480 BC.

Although an attempt is made to be international, some entries are extremely
Euro-centric. For example, the entry on fermentation is dated 1800 BCE, but
according to Wikipedia, fermentation was actually first done in 6000 BCE in
china. Many other inventions also chronicle explicitly the arrival of the
technology to Europe, such as Gunpowder which is dated 1249 CE but as the entry
admits, was first used to scare Chinese enemies in 1044 CE. The listed date was
when the technology arrived in Europe and was perfected to make serious
weaponry. My last critique is that some of the writing felt stilted and
inconsistent. I imagine that Asimov worked more on the skeleton, and perhaps let
a ghostwriter fill in the details.

Despite some shortcomings, Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery is a
really impressive tome, and a reference book I'll keep close by. I've started on
a summary of the chronology in [spreadsheet
form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lBahJh5UEYEPgamNpyWAaxAQOLO6088nLiBjQW9zr2U/edit?usp=sharing).
Please help me by filling in the remainder of the spreadsheet for the remaining
500 years (1519 - 2019). My goal is to ultimately generate a visual,
Civilization-style technology tree for this whole book.


Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich
===
posted: July 14, 2019
rating: no

> I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. – Mark Twain

A lot of this book agrees emphatically with this Twain quote. Fundamentally,
Illich believes that "universal education through schooling is not feasible". 
Did you know that "schole", the origin of the word "school" and "школа", is the
greek word for leisure? The book is written as a collection of essays. Overall,
Illich is an Anarchist, and the essays are too radical for me temperament.

## Why We Must Disestablish School

A scathing, radical critique of modernity:

> Medical treatment is mistaken for healthcare, social work for the improvement
of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national
security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity,
independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the
performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends.

Illich also seems to think that schools are flawed because they won't lead to
equal outcomes for rich and poor. But he seems to discount the fact that a poor
but schooled person would presumably be better off than a poor unschooled one. A
rising tide lifts all boats.

One area where I agree is to "detach competence from curriculum", and make it
taboo to ask people where they studied and how they came to have their skills.
Another interesting argument is that "most learning happens casually", in the
way that children learn a language, or even adults do it situationally (rarely
in language class).

Illich strongly advocates for apprenticeship models, arguing that "all education
was complex, lifelong, and unplanned". He gives examples of making schooling
more effective by taking into account personalized context: "Paolo Freire [...]
discovered that any adult can begin to read in a matter of fourty hours if
the first words he deciphers are charged with political meaning."

He suggests opening the market to for students to find appropriate teachers for
them. Even more intriguingly, here's a startup idea. I've redacted some
antiquated parts (the essay is written in 1970):

> Each man [...] could identify himself to a computer, indicating the book,
article, film, or recording on which he seeks a partner for discussion [...] and
arrange for a meeting with others who recently had taken the same initiative.

Imagine doing this today, restoring coffee shops as [social
infrastructure](/books/palaces-for-the-people) for [intellectual
conversation](/books/the-coffee-house-a-cultural-history/).

School, Illich argues, is divisive, splintering society into the schooled (white
collar) and unschooled (blue collar). Education becomes unworldly and the world
becomes noneducation.

## Phenomenology of School

> The school system is a modern phenomenon, as is the childhood it produces.

Fascinatingly, until the Second Vatican Council in 1962, each child was
instructed that a Christian reaches moral discernment and freedom at the age of
seven.

I think Illich unfairly claims that adults tend to romanticize their schooling,
attributing their learning to a beloved teacher, not giving enough credit to
teachers that really inspire their pupils, spot talent, provide encouragement.
Surely many pupils end up pursuing higher ed in a field because of a high school
teacher.

But he fairly critiques the institution of school for giving a single teacher
too many roles: "custodian, preacher/moralist, and therapist".

Overall I find his take super idealistic. I wonder if he had kids? The fact that
school provides childcare is like a super important aspect of it for most
families, and increasingly so as more women are in the workforce.

I got through the third essay, but it was a slog. Overall, there are interesting
tidbits but the overall tone is so anarchic, marxist and idealistic, I found it
a draining read.


Palaces for the People (audio)
===
posted: June 27, 2019
rating: no

The phrase "palaces for the people" comes from Andrew Carnegie. A prolific
philanthropist, Carnegie helped to fund more than 2,500 libraries around the
world.

Initially excited by a systematic, long form look into an issue I care deeply
about, I picked up this book after hearing Eric Klinenberg talk on 99%
Invisible. Reading the book, I found the library-related discussions to be most
coherent, and also found many disparate nuggets that piqued my curiosity,
including many social-minded projects I hadn't heard of before. But overall,
the book's scope is so huge that I think the author failed to conjure a coherent
narrative. In addition, I often found the tone overly didactic and pandering to
a particular audience.

The author draws on a wide variety of authors I've recently become familiar with:

- Robert Putnam (Bowling Alone): social capital has been declining since the
  1960s.
- Charles Murray (Coming Apart)
- Jane Jacobs (The Death and Life of Great American Cities)
- James Scott (Seeing Like a State): high modernism and optimization is at odds
  with social infrastructure.
- Sherry Turkle (Alone Together): we don't talk to each other anymore because of
  digital devices.

Surprising facts about libraries:

- Usage is increasing in the US.
- Circulation is led by Seattle in annual book circulation per capita.
- Along with Military and First Responders, the most respected institutions.
- Used in a wide variety of ways, far more than just lending books
  (eg. virtual senior bowling leagues -- take that Robert Putnam)

My favorite part included examples of hard infrastructure (eg. electric grid,
sewer system, transit networks, levies) doubling as social infrastructure.  A
levy can double as a walking path. An example is a new project in Manhattan
called the [Big
U](http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/our-work/all-proposals/winning-projects/big-u),
where flood walls will double as gallery and public space.  This is just like
the Richmond Dyke, an embankment which prevents the suburb where I grew up from
flooding. Richmond is below sea level, and situated in a river delta. Also, old
physical infrastructure can be repurposed to be more social. This often happens
with waterfront renovation projects. For example, when the Embarcadero highway
fell in the 1989 SF quake, it was converted into a much better waterfront. In
Seattle and Vancouver, viaducts along the water are being replaced with much
more human-friendly infrastructure. Tons of examples of former rail lines being
turned into vibrant public spaces:

- New Orleans: Lafitte Greenway
- Atlanta: Green Belt
- Seattle: Burke Gilman Trail
- Portland: Springwater Corridor

Speaking of public spaces, Frederick Law Olmsted and his sons were also
mentioned. This gave me an excuse to look a bit deeper. Like Carnegie, who left
a legacy in libraries, the Olmsteads left their legacy in America's parks.
Olmstead Sr. is considered the father of landscape architecture, and his son FLO
Jr. designed Olmstead Point in Yosemite, one of my favorite places. As it turns
out, the Olmstead brothers [planned most of Seattle's
parks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Olmsted\_parks\_in\_Seattle).

Also interesting discussion about public baths and their role as social
infrastructure. In Finland the public pools help build social cohesion.
Swimming in the same place means you accept other bodies. They are used to meet
neighbors, and even complain to elected representatives. Of course, Finland is
quite demographically homogenous. In contrast, the US had many pool related
battles between blacks and whites during the Civil Rights era. 

Among the painful parts of the book hand wringing about the veracity of the
Broken Window Theory. But the conclusion is what really put a nail in the
coffin. Suddenly all of the memes are in full force: Trump is Evil Incarnate.
Tech is to blame for all of the Bay Area's problems. Facebook is The Absolute
Worst. It's not that I disagree with these sentiments, but stop flogging a dead
horse. (Meta: one of the reasons I love books is that they are timeless, and
less about knee-jerk reactions to current events. This is less true for new
releases that have not passed the test of time.)

The author defines Social Infrastructure as "the physical conditions that
determine if social capital can flourish". Immediately my mind went to the
digital equivalent: Social **Digital** Infrastructure. "the **physical**
conditions that determine if social capital can flourish".

Fundamentally, this book cements an idea I've been wrangling with. Over the last
little while, I've attempted a number of projects that try to improve social
discourse online. That they have all failed does not necessarily mean that there
is no hope for systems that try to foster social infrastructure digitally, but I
now believe that my efforts were somewhat misguided. I strongly agree with this
sentiment expressed by the author:

> Local face to face interactions are the building blocks of all public life.

I would have liked to read more about examples of digital infrastructure
intended to impact the real world. Also, why does Meetup have such awful
attrition? I propose a law:

> **Law of Meetup Attrition**: the number of people that show up to an event is
1/3 the number of people that sign up for it. The number of people that sign up
to an event is 1/30 the number of people in the meetup group.

Successful unmentioned examples of social digital infrastructure that come to
mind are the [Little Free Library project][2], and
[PEPS in Seattle][3].


The Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson (audio)
===
posted: June 14, 2019
rating: yes

As a kid, I read The Odyssey in some canonical translation. That is to say, I
knew it was a classic, and wanted to check the box. I read it quickly and
retained nothing from the experience. When I learned about this new, accessible
translation from Tyler Cowen's interview with the translator, my interest was
piqued.

In an extended intro, Wilson justified the constraints of her translation. I
agreed with her that constraints are fun to work within, and found the specifics
of translating from dactylic hexameter the meter of all homeric epic poems, to
iambic pentameter the usual meter of English classics to be super
interesting. Impressively, she also constrained herself to the same number of
lines as the original. All this while keeping to modern language that isn't
overly flowery or archaic. In her own words:

> But of course, the English of the nineteenth or early twentieth century is no
closer to Homeric Greek than the language of today. The use of a noncolloquial
or archaizing linguistic register can blind readers to the real, inevitable, and
vast gap between the Greek original and any modern translation. My use of
contemporary language—rather than the English of a generation or two ago—is
meant to remind readers that this text can engage us in a direct way, and also
that it is genuinely ancient. My Homer does not speak in your grandparents'
English, since that language is no closer to the wine-dark sea than your own. I
have tried to keep to a register that is recognizably speakable and readable,
while skirting between the Charybdis of artifice and the Scylla of slang.

I loved Claire Danes' reading of the translated poem, and Audible's production,
especially that little blooming musical flourish in the end. I wonder how hard
it was for the producers to be so parsimonious with effects.


## Recurring themes

- **Hospitality**: There's a steady emphasis on hospitality as a way to appease
  gods, especially Zeus. There is an element of it being encouraged in general,
  and an element of fear: any old beggar may in fact be a god in disguise. It
  plays out in the narrative too when the suitors' evil is illustrated in their
  disdain for Odysseus disguised as a beggar.
- **Weaving women**: Every great woman spins cloth, including all noble wives
  and most notably Penelope.
- **Gods concealing as humans**: Athena is often disguised as Mentor,
  Telemachus' ally and advisor. The pattern of Gods disguised as familiar people
  is super compelling as a narrative device. There are moments in life
  when it feels that way, no?
- **Constant bitching**: Odysseus is constant bitching about how hard his life
  is, while his crew is dying left and right. This is odd -- under such dire
  circumstances, should he not be glad to be alive?
- **Metaphors for Dawn**: I really liked all of the descriptions of Dawn. Rosy
  fingered, braided, Dawn on her golden throne, bright-throned Dawn.
- **Awesome monsters**: Polyphemus the cyclops eats Odysseus' crew, Circe the
  nymph turns them into swine, The Sirens lure his men to thier doom, Scylla, a
  giant six headed sea hydra decimates his ships and Charybdis, a whirlpool
  monster, threatens to be his end.
- **Bards rock**: bards, poets and singers are universally great. They bring the
  people to tears, and generally speaking, survive.

## Answered questions

- After sneezing, Russians sometimes say "truth". There is a passage related to
  this, and I got curious. Does the Russian tradition come from the Greek?
  [Apparently][4],
  [yes][5].
- Athena continually disguises as Mentor, a man in Odysseus entourage. Mentor is
  also extremely wise and a great advisor to Telemachus. Is this the origin of
  the word? [Apparently yes][6]
- Are Phaeacian Phoenicians? There are similarities beyond their names, like
  great skill in navigation. I answered this myself since eventually both
  appeared in The Odyssey as distinct peoples. However there is some interesting
  [academic
  writing](https://www.academia.edu/7299720/Homer\_s\_Phaeacians\_and\_Phoenician\_Bi-lingual\_Onomastica.docx)
  on this: "The onomastic qualities of Phaeacian personal names in book 6-8 of
  the Odyssey further indicate that the bard envisioned the Phaeacians as a
  fantastical clone of the real-world Phoenicians." 

## Narrative observations

The story itself was pretty clear, but I was super confused about Odysseus' side
trip to Hades. I had to read about it separately. The trip was just to talk to a
prophet in order to find out what to do next? Such a needless tangent.

There is some complex structure in the narrative. Big chunks of the story are
narrated by the actors themselves. Odysseus retells part of his story to King
Alcinous (Father of Nausicaa). Telemecus reveals a sparknotes version of The
Iliad when he visits Nestor.

One of the greatest scenes must have been Odysseus confronting the suitors as a
beggar in his own house. It's so vividly written, with great details including
Argos' death. This is apparently the only time the dog is ever mentioned, but it
makes the listener feel as if there's so much more to the story.

Although the narrator is clearly on Odysseus side, his decision to kill all of
the suitors was clearly disproportionate to their crimes. It's easy to imagine
Odysseus as a villan, triply so with the mass strangulation of slave girls that slept
with the suitors, and his vicious torture of Melanthius. 

Is this really the end of Odysseus' adventures? As soon as he returns, he must
venture off again to appease Posideon. Sounds like another arduous journey, and
another decade of disappointment for Penelope. Her patience and the ambiguity
with which they reunite is palpable.



The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin
===
posted: May 22, 2019
rating: yes

The Fifth Season is a well crafted fantasy book, the first of the Broken Earth
trilogy. Each book in the trilogy won a Hugo Award in subsequent years, which is an
unprecedented achievement. But even more importantly, my wife discovered it and
recommended it to me! Overall, I found the book to be very original, but
had a few gripes too. The best parts were the slow reveal and the world
building, but I found the beginning to be boring, and struggled a bit with
identity politics.

Jemisin's world building is very compelling. She created an interesting,
completely original universe based on tectonic plates, the earth itself, and
seismic activity. The earth-like setting is incredibly seismically active, and
some humans have some ability to control this activity, either suppressing
shakes or creating their own. There are also humanoids that appear to be made of
rock, and other interesting fauna. I really liked kirkhusas for some reason. One of the
great things about the way the book is written is that all aspects of the world
reveal themselves very slowly. Two thirds of the way in, I was still confused
about the mechanics of earth manipulation, the politics of the realm, who the
characters really were. I also loved the way that that three distinct story
lines merged into two, then one. 

Two aspects that I didn't like are as follows. Firstly, I found the sex towards
the end of the book to be surprising. The first encounter with Inon devolved
into a really a weird scene, and I felt that the whole book risked devolving
into smarmy rom. 

Secondly, it is an underdog story that feels a bit too black and white. Those
that control the earth form an underclass, despite their great innate power.
They are subjugated by non-magical people that control them through their
evil, hierarchical bureaucracy. The author does a great job conveying emotions,
especially of the female characters. Their frequent frustration is palpable.

I really wish I didn’t know the identity of the author before reading. This was
inevitable, as her picture prominently features on the inside cover. As a
result, I was distracted by the emphasis on female protagonists and racial
analogies. Even the word "rogga" connotes very directly another racially
derogatory term that has no place on this page. In that political light, I was
somewhat surprised at the revolutionary tone the author sets, especially towards
the end of the book, and particularily in the cryptic ending. I suppose it's a
powerful hook to read the next book in the trilogy.




Radical Markets by Posner and Weyl
===
posted: April 18, 2019
rating: no

The book Radical Markets is centered on one central premise: \*\*Competitive, free
markets are awesome, but most in reality are either not perfectly competitive,
or insufficiently free\*\*.

Overall, the book covers a lot of ground, proposing solutions to many of
modernity's major questions, from immigration to monopolies to property rights.
I found the tone to be overly enthusiastic, and annoyingly focused on the word
"radical". Although the authors try to provide nuance sometimes, for example
emphasizing that they would like to see their ideas applied gradually and after
small scale testing, it still reads more like a manifesto or a series of
pamphlets than like a coherent book.

That said, I found that the "everything is a market" lens to be pretty
interesting. I disagree with most of the specific implementations that
the authors suggest, partly because they are so specific, partly because they
are so extreme. At the same time, I appreciate that they propose specific policy
rather than general platitudes. We live in interesting times, and the [Overton
window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton\_window) is wider today than ever
in my lifetime. It is a good time to try to unbundle the author's ideas and find
the worthy nuggets.

## Auctions for everything, ever

By the mid 20th century, Henry George was "by far the most famous American
economic writer", having written Progress and Poverty (1879), which sold
millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before
that time. The central idea of [Georgism][7] is:

> while people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value
derived from land (often including natural resources and natural opportunities)
should belong equally to all members of society.

The authors take some Georgist ideas and try to apply them with the goal of
reducing inequality. For example, they claim that real estate is not a
competitive market. A particular property may be unique, and thus a sort of
micro-monopoly, despite other supply being available. The authors often cite
holdouts as common roadblocks for developing large infrastructural projects.
While the government could use its power of eminent domain, a private venture to
build a high speed rail line from Seattle to Vancouver would be impossible.

The authors propose a wealth tax on all property, in a form of
[Vickrey auctions][8]:

> Every citizen and especially corporation would self-assess the value of assets
they possess, pay a roughly 7% tax on these values and be required to sell the
assets to anyone willing to purchase them at this self-assessed price.

A wealth tax is a [great way to reduce
inequality](/simulating-wealth-inequality/), but the authors bundle it together
with the above self-evaluation scheme. If you self-evaluate too low in order to
pay less in taxes, you may lose your property to a buyer that has found a great
deal. Conversely, if you self-evaluate too high in order to ensure that you
won't be bought out, you will pay more in taxes.

While this is pareto optimal, the obvious objection in practice is that it may
be rather annoying for residents of North Seattle to suddenly be bought up by
Jeff Bezos for his new private spaceport. I think I'd rather see a world in
which the government is more empowered to take on large public works, and more
agressively uses its power of eminent domain for the common good.

## A market for voting

What if we treated voting like a market too? Imagine saving up your votes for an
issue you really care about. Why is it that we are so attached to the idea of
one person, one vote?

The authors criticize Likert scales for producing results that tend towards
extremes. This is interesting to me, since a lot of political surveys use likert
scales, as do many HCI studies. I'm a bit confused about this claim, since there
is evidence that likert responders have a [central
tendency](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-017-1344-2).

Here again, the authors take multiple ideas and bundle them together into a
large package. They introduce [Quadratic
Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting), a collective decision
making procedure where participants can indicate how strongly they feel about an
issue.  Logistically, you are given a number of credits that you can allocate to
a set of issues. You can allocate multiple credits per issue if you care more
about it, but `votes = sqrt(credits)`. The authors found that this leads to a
more realistic breakdown of people's preferences, following what we'd expect: a
normal distribution.

The idea that you have a finite number of credits to allocate to some set of
issues entails trade-offs. To me this artificial scarcity is the main appeal of
the QV idea, since it mirrors finite resources of the real world. However, the
author's insistence that the dropoff should specifically quadratic seemed a bit
odd. Why not exponential? Why not a power other than two?  Maybe this is
discussed in more technical detail in another paper.

I'd love to see some sort of bounded credit allocation scheme used in more
surveys. Partly because this gives people a chance to do an initial allocation,
then think more about trade-offs. This reflects reality in a way to unbounded
surveys do not. The down side is that it's also a lot more annoying to do.


## Everybody gets an immigrant

Large volumes of migration between countries is a relatively recent phenomenon.
That's because:

1. Modernity makes it easier to travel. Even if conditions in a country were
   terrible (persecution or economically), it was very hard to leave.
2. There is a lot more economic inequality between countries. This started to
   happen in the colonial era, and continues today.

In light of this increased movement, and the controversy that immigration has
caused in recent years, the authors propose a truly insane idea. What if
citizens could sponsor migrants from other countries in the same way that they
can sponsor family members? The authors flesh out what this might look like, and
even their own description paints an extremely precarious picture. Sponsor and
invitee would be matched through some kind of agency and meet over a series of
video chats. The sponsor would then be on the hook for finding housing, a job,
and guaranteeing the good behavior of their guest. In exchange, the sponsor
benefits from partaking in cultural exchange, and potential profit by
capitalizing on the guest's low salary. If the guest misbehaves, they are
expelled back to their home country, and their sponsor is reprimanded.

At the end of the discussion, the authors estimate that 1/3 of all Americans
would sponsor an immigrant through this program, based on the insane assumption
that every working age adult would want to participate. This is hilariously
optimistic. Just because something works for the Au Pair program which is very
small scale, specific, and in which the guest lives and works in your own home,
does not mean it will scale to full generality.


## Break up all the corporations

Institutional investors like Vanguard and Blackrock have huge capital and can
invest in a whole sector, reducing competition within it. Specifically, authors
cite examples of multiple airlines serving the same route with funding from the
same investors causing inflated prices because of cartel-like behaviors.

The authors suggest to only allow institutional investors to invest in one
corporation per industry. but it's kind of unclear as to how to enforce this.
Defining which form is in which industry can be a real challenge. What is a tech
company even, and is "tech" a meaningful industry, or is Google just an ads
company?

I'm sympathetic to one idea that the authors write about, echoing Senator
Warren's recent demands for more government control over startups being acuired
by tech giants. These acquisitions lead to a concentration of power in large
companies, and ultimatley a tendency towards monopoly. The social empire that is
concentrated in Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram just gives too much data to one
corporation. In addition to providing consumers less choice, especially if the
acquired company's product is sunset, these acquisitions reduce competitive
pressure on the behemoth.


## Release the chains of data serfdom

Advances in modern AI require mounds of human-created data. ML engineers at tech
companies transform this data into really impressive machine learning models. A
handful of research scientists develop new ML techniques. Only the engineers and
scientists get paid in the process.

In the chapter/pamphlet, the authors, citing Jaron Lanier heavily, argue that
the people that provide data should be adequately compensated. Traditional
statistics would argue that each data point has only a small marginal value. For
any given problem (eg. Face identification), each new labeled face provides
diminishing returns. The authors compellingly argue that many new ML problems
can be trained with the same labeled data, which makes the data itself more
valuable.

This is a pretty good argument, but the main challenge here seems to be
logistical: how do you decide how much to pay people for their data, and how do
you actually pay them? One problem with the idea of paying for all "data work"
is that a lot of user data is organically collected by people using a product,
not explicitly for the demands of a specific Machine Learning problem. If users
were to be asked for explicit data, that would be off-putting. As mentioned in
the book, having a paid contract emphasizes the idea that what you were already
doing for fun is actually work that deserves renumeration.

One thing skimped in the book is that it really depends on what the actual data
is. Google Translate is trained on human translations, which require substantial
translation skill by professional translators, who are very likely underpaid
today. It would make perfect sense for translators to receive commission from
tech companies for using their output to train translation models. In contrast,
face identification is trained on photographs of faces with labels around the
face, which anyone with a pulse can produce.

As an aside: I found the constant analogy between "women’s work", slavery and
serfdom to “data work” to be annoying and misleading. The authors love to
brandish loud colloquialisms like "techno feudalism" and "siren servers". I wish
they would stop! Unlike feudalism, Facebook is not a mandatory, all encompassing
system that controls your work and life. Unlike slavery, data work does not
capitalize at the expense of a specific identity group. Unlike "siren servers",
the lure of social networks can be resisted.


Seeing Like a State by James Scott
===
posted: March 28, 2019
rating: yes

The most succinct version summary of Seeing Like a State this is what has been
called The Authoritarian High-Modernist [Recipe for Failure][9]:

1. Look at a complex and confusing reality
2. Fail to understand all the subtleties of how the complex reality works
3. Attribute that failure to the irrationality of what you are looking at,
   rather than your own limitations
4. Come up with an idealized blank-slate vision of what that reality ought to
   look like
5. Argue that the relative simplicity and platonic orderliness of the vision
   represents rationality
6. Use authoritarian power to impose that vision, by demolishing the old reality
   if necessary
7. Watch your rational Utopia fail horribly

On the other hand, humanity has clearly benefitted from modern institutions that
scale. Scale requires optimization. Optimization requires simplification.
But overly simplified schemes dehumanify people, converting humans into drones
lacking agency and autonomy. My main question going into this book: how to
strike the right balance?

Anyway, back to the book: Scott goes through many different examples of the
above scheme in practice.

## Scientific Forestry

Pioneers of modern forestry viewed forests as factories for growing trees:

> "One should manage the forest so as to guarantee the highest sustained
financial revenue, when all usable products are calculated in money." –
Friedrich Wilhelm Pfeil, the first director of the Eberswald Academy of Forestry
(1856)

This led to the unintended consequence of forest dieback. A century later, an
observer wrote:

> Many of the pure stands [of spruce] grew excellently in the first generation
but already showed an amazing retrogression [decline in yields] in the second
generation.” – Richard Plochmann, District Chief of the Bavarian Forest Service
(1968)

## City Planning

Modern planners believed that city planning can be done abstractly, without any
regard for the specifics of the city's residents.  Le Corbusier's vantage point
is entirely external to the city, completely devoid of cultural context of the
people he was building for. The resulting city was perfect for an average human
that didn't exist. His plans were best seen from an airplane, and his sketches
entering the port on or ship. Le Corbusier's concerns are visual. 

> "Houses are machines for living in." – Le Corbusier (1923)

This led to planned cities like Brasilia and Chandigarh. These cities were
visually appealing from abstract vantage points, but not functionally livable.
They worked for people only because of an inevitable departure from the
architect's master plan, molding it to their actual needs.

One anecdote was particularly striking to me. Le Corbusier went so far as to
design plans for Moscow that were judged too radical by the Soviets. Unfazed, he
took the same plans and recycled them to use for central Paris!  In contrast,
Jane Jacobs in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, championed
function over form, and walked in the shoes of a resident of the city.

## Russian Revolution

Lenin believed that communism must be brought in through violent revolution.

> "The organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the
purpose of crushing the oppressors." - Lenin (1917)

He viewed the Vanguard Party as a machine for bringing on communism. Needless to
say, the revolution led to a huge loss of life, and then even more in the
repressions that followed. Conflicts with the Kulaks over collectivisation led
to a terrible decline in quality of life for farmers and workers that Lenin was
trying to help.

Rosa Luxemburg, a Marxist theorist and anti-war activist, and her spiritual
successor Alexandra Kollontai, a Russian Menshevik, had a very different take on
communism. Theirs was a nature-inspired view of social uprisings, strife, and
revolution. This bottom-up view was diametrically opposed to Lenin's top-down
view.

There are striking parallels with Jane Jacobs' critique of Le Corbusier.
Is it a coincidence that in both cases, it is a woman's humanistic, nuanced, and
intuitive tendencies criticizing the iron fisted absolution of a man?

## Agriculture

Modern farming views the farm as a factory for producing food. The bigger and
more specialized, the better. This trend was present both in the west and in the
east in the early twentieth century, but it is illuminating to see the
differences in approach. This illustrates a point Scott hedges on repeatedly,
that high modernism by itself is not the problem, but requires authoritarianism
to lead to disastrous results.

In America, large industrial farms led to bad outcomes, but these did not lead
to massive famines or millions of deaths. In the east, the sheer scale of the
operation led to disaster. Early Kolhoz were created by dividing whole swaths of
Russia into a grid of 2500 hectare plots, and requiring quotas from each "farm"
without much regard for whether the land was arable or not. Collectivization in
the Soviet Union and China led to large scale famines and millions of deaths.

On the topic of agriculture, Scott explicitly mentioned one feedback loop I
found interesting. Crops were modified to make them more amenable to mechanized
picking. This led to a monoculture and a more fragile crop, and thus to
increased pesticide use.


## Applications to corporations

One of the major ideas in the book is legibility, the process by which modern
states, over a long period of time, attempt to understand society, simplify it,
and make it more managable. In Scott's own words, to

> arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of
taxation, conscription, and prevention of rebellion.  Having begun to think in
these terms, I began to see legibility as a central problem in statecraft. The
pre-modern state was, in many crucial respects, particularly blind; it knew
precious little about its subjects, their wealth, their landholdings and yields,
their location, their very identity. It lacked anything like a detailed “map” of
its terrain and its people.

It struck me that a lot of Scott's critiques apply to corporations just as much
as they do to governments. In many cases, tech companies are in the business of
taking an existing practice and digitizing it.  Companies like Convoy and Cloud
Kitchens, in an attempt to digitize the physical, are implicitly increasing
legibility and imposing the same sorts of potential pitfalls that will be
described in this book.

In particular, this involves the following:

1. Understand the physical world
2. Predict the future state of the physical world
3. Control the future state of the physical world

This is exactly the same sequence of steps that most of the high modernist
examples in this book undertake.


## Recipes for success

Scott has a few suggestions which I succinctly summarize "be humble". He
explicitly writes:

- Take small steps, observe results, repeat.
- Make sure the steps are reversible. The first rule of intelligent tinkering is
  to save all the parts. (Aldo Leopold)
- Plan for surprises.
- Plan on human inventiveness. 

Scott uses "metis", a Greek word for know-how, or cunning, or chutzpah, to
describe a lot of what's missing in high modernist ideology. Metis refers to the
sorts of things that cannot be taught, but must be practiced, like riding a
bike, playing an instrument. Scott argues this understanding of the practical is
critical for any high modernist scheme, as the scheme is inevitably overly
simplifying, so gaps emerge that need to be filled.

Metis has led to folk discoveries that were done by non-scientific method were
often rediscovered by science in some form and formalized. Scott makes a sort of
prediction that this traditionally derived wisdom is still far ahead of
scientific discovery in some domains, such as poly-cropping for example.

One common theme across all of the high modernist failures is mechamorphism:
everything is a machine. For Le Corbusier, the house was a machine for living
in. For Lenin, the vanguard party was a machine for bringing forth communism.
For practitioners of Forstwissenschaft, forests were factories for making trees,
and farms are factories for making food. It's easy to make fun of, but maybe today's metaphors will be similarly flawed?


## Seeing Like a State and AI

Speaking of today's metaphors...

In the spirit of Chesterton's Fence, it's worth taking a closer look at
simplifying schemes that we take for granted. They may actually have adverse
side effects. Can we undo them through a better understanding of the things
that came before them?

High modernism often fails because it is overly reductive. I keep wondering: can
we better understand complex, natural domains with modern technology? We've made
really great progress in some areas like speech recognition. Can we apply
AI to better understand complex domains without being overly reductive and
prescriptive? For example, what if we built a gardening AI to take meticulous
care of an organic polyculture farm?

Imagine a future in which a series of complex, domain-specialized AIs have been
created in such domains as gardening and driving. We may well end
up with systems that work super well, but are [far less legible][10]. What
would the ensuing world look like? I'm imagining self driving cars with emergent
swarming behaviors that look completely terrifying from the sky, but would be
very functional and completely safe (as long as no humans were involved in
driving decisions). I feel that we are very far from such a world, but it's fun
to think about.


Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino
===
posted: February 22, 2019
rating: yes

Calvino writes in some of the most poetic prose in my recent memory. At times it
borders on obscurity, but often it is beautiful almost beyond words.

Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan stories of the cities he's been to. A handful of
cities are each vividly described in a few paragraphs, and then we return to the
court, where Polo, diplomatic like a dragoman, tends to Khan's whims. 

Are all of these cities metaphors for facets of a single city? Are the cities
real? Has Polo even been to them? Are Khan and Polo really communicating
non-verbally, in gestures and dances? Everything has an ethereal feel, and all
of the aforementioned questions are raised by the author himself, and all turn
out to be irrelevant. 

At the same time, Calvino captures truths and conveys ideas with the emotional
valence that only good fiction writers can. All the while, the descriptions of
his cities are masterfully written, and incredibly imaginative. Some of my
highlights follow.

A familiar feeling when traveling:

> Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant
that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in
time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he
had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the
place of that man in that square.

Another familiar feeling:

> “Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to
resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless
dust cloud invades the continents.

So imaginative:

> You do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night,
by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out
on piles of carpets, at each word that one man says—such as “wolf,” “sister,”
“hidden treasure,” “battle,” “scabies,” “lovers”—the others tell, each one, his
tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that
in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camel’s swaying
or the junk’s rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your
wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle
other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at
every solstice and at every equinox.

And vivid:

> Thus the city repeats its life, identical, shifting up and down on its empty
chessboard. The inhabitants repeat the same scenes, with the acton changed; they
repeat the same speeches with variously combined accents; they open alternate
mouths in identical yawns. Alone, among all the cities of the empire, Eutropia
remains always the same. Mercury, god of the fickle, to whom the city is sacred,
worked this ambiguous miracle.

High modernist failure mode (after a generation, residents of the planned city
Perinthia gradually turn into by monsters):

> Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must
admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to
describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is
reflected exactly in the city of monsters.



The Story of Medieval England (audio)
===
posted: February 19, 2019
rating: yes

In the grand scheme of things, the western world today is pretty great. To what
do we owe its prosperity? I got curious about this and realized that the answer
probably lies in the broader traditions of the anglosphere. I'd heard of the
Magna Carta, and even seen it, but what was the big deal? Anyway, in my quest to
understand, I came across this great series of lectures covering English history
from around the 9th to the 15th century. Paxton does a great job of bringing
life to what I've felt to be an often dry and confusing time and place. The
narrative is mostly chronological, but once in a while, she pauses and explores
an area in depth to great effect. I enjoyed the many cross-references the
lecturer made throughout the lecture, her etymological diversions, and lively
depictions of heroes and villans, and also references to popular culture (movies
mostly).

## English chronology, roughly speaking 900 - 1500

(Imagine reading these in the style of Drunk History, I think it works best)

In the 8th century, England was split into seven kingdoms, each with its own
local lords. These kingdoms were loosely organized into counties called Shires,
each overseen by a Sheriff. This structure was originally military in nature,
each shire producing some quota of soldiers to fight on behalf of the local
lord. During this period, England was plagued by Danish invaders. Eventually,
all but Wessex came under Danish control, until the ruler of Wessex, Alfred the
Great, pushed back against the Danes and reconquered all of England. This didn't
last long though, and eventually the Danish and previous residents of England
melded into one people. However this was a troubled time, full of chaos and
internal strife and a lack of central control over the country. (TV show to
watch: The Last Kingdom)

**William the Conqueror** was a Norman (ie. descended from Norwegians who had
conquered and settled in the north of France). After a series of failed kings,
England's succession was unclear. William crossed the channel and burned farms,
cutting off the food supply to London, and sieging it. Eventually William
controlled both Normandy and England. He effectively suppressed rebellion and
got the nobles on his side. English society eventually subsumed Norman culture.

William's succession story is very colorful. Upon his gruesome death, his eldest
son took England, while his middle son took Normandy. The eldest went on the
first crusade, leaving England on lease to his brother. Meanwhile, Henry, the
youngest of the three, got nothing. After his middle brother died in a hunting
accident, Henry came to control both Normandy and England. Upon his return from
crusade, Henry imprisoned his oldest brother for the rest of his life (30
years?!). As king, **Henry I** made many changes, instituted the exchequer post
and appointed officials based on merit rather than birth.

Henry I's only son drowned in a drunken boat party. In his stead, Henry I
favored his daughter Matilda who was married off to the Holy Roman Emperor. But
queens weren't exactly a thing yet, so a succession dispute led to \*\*King
Steven\*\* coming to power. Steven was and not a very kingly man, and not a very
effective king. Anarchy and a civil war in erupted in England over Steven's
legitimacy, with Matilda's vying to get Henry, her son from her second
marriage onto the throne. 

Eventually she succeeded, and **Henry II**'s reign was focused on mending the
damage done by the civil war, reuniting England and Normandy, and restoring it
to grandpa William's glory. Henry II married Eleanor of Acquitaine, further
expanding his empire into France. Sadly his reign was undone by a conflict with
Thomas Beckett, formerly his right hand man, but now the archbishop of
Canterbury. When he had Beckett killed for disobedience, he became deeply
unpopular and Becket was canonized as a saint. (Movie: Beckett)

Henry II was succeeded by his son Richard I, know as **Richard the Lionheart**.
He was extremely popular for his military prowess, as well as patronage of arts
and literature, especially the new genre of Legends of King Arthur, and Courtly
Love. He went on the third pilgrimage, by which point Saladin had already
reconquered Jerusalem. But Richard succeeded in defeating Saladin at Acco, which
remained European controlled for a century. 

Upon Richard's death, he was succeeded by brother John. **King John** was not a
good king, cruel, and petulant. John managed to lose all of England's holdings
in France. He alienated his barons to such a degree that many of them banded
together to impose a great charter (Magna Carta) on John, designed to curtail
his power. This included trial by a jury of peers, and also no extraordinary
taxation without cause. John got Pope Innocent to repudiate the Magna Carta. and
eventually many English lords sided with the French, backing prince Louis as the
English king. John's son Henry succeeded him, and managed to best Louis and
win support of the English nobles with the help of William Marshall. 

Under **Henry III**, the baronial conflicts continued. The Magna Carta was
reinstated, but still Henry III and his barons had many disagreements.
Especially on the foreign policy front, Henry III had many strange and foolish
ideas, attempting to reconquer Poitu in France, to place his brother on the
Sicilian throne, and to prevent lords from going on crusade. Every time the king
asked for a concession, the barons would trade it for more political power.
Eventually this led to the Treaty of Oxford, which extended the Magna Carta,
giving barons more power to appoint councils and administrators to effectively
run the country. Henry accepts the treaty but then reneged with the support of
an invited arbitrator St. Louis, King of France. The barons rebelled and forced
his hand. Simon de Montfort, leader of the baronial revolt also formalized the
structure of the parliament (from parle) which was formerly entirely informally
called by the king when he wanted to raise money. Now the parliament would meet
regularly, and be composed of 2 knights from each shire, and 2 members from
specific boroughs, elected locally. This structure clearly precedes that of The
House.

**Edward I**, Henry III's son, succeeded him, to a collective baronial relief.
He was much more level headed than his father. Edward went on crusade, just like
the legendary and much loved Richard I. Edward passed many reforms to the common
law. In my books, he is ultimately a villan. He passed an Edict which banned
Jews from England, which lasted for the next 350 years, until Cromwell allowed
their return in the 17th century. In the grand scheme, this may be a greater
travesty than the Spanish Inquisition!

**Edward II** succeeded his well loved father, and had an unpopular reign. He
was accused of homosexuality because of his closeness with his nearest advisor,
Galston. The barons hated this so much, they successfully expelled Galston to
France five times, and eventually murdered him. The barons attempted to rise up
against the king, but their efforts were quashed. The rebellion's leader was
murdered as retribution without a trial, which didn't help Ed's popularity. Also
Edward II suffered humiliating defeat at the hands of Robert the Bruce in
Scotland. Ultimately he was deposed by his barons and placed in prison, where he
died, possibly by being disemboweled as punishment for his lifestyle choices.
His wife allied herself with the Barons, and succeeded in getting their son Ed
III to the throne.

**Edward III** started his career as king under the thumb of his mother and her
lover. When he grew old enough, Ed III took over in a coup and took the reigns.
For a while he was also a legitimate heir to the French throne through his
mother's line. Ultimately he conquered a bunch of French lands, including Calais
in the north which was strategically important because it was the opposing port
to Dover and constituted the shortest crossing of the channel. Rodin's famous
sculpture of the six nobleman of Calais depicts a an event that actually
happened where Edward III picked out six noblemen of Calais to be hung for their
subordination, but conceded when his pregnant wife begged for mercy. Generally a
very successful Ed III is remembered fondly in contrast to his father.

To finance the Hundred Years War against France, Edward III introduced a tax
that affected everyone, even the poorest. Previously taxes only applied to
people that owned goods, effectively a wealth tax. This new head tax also rose
over time. Also, papal patronage meant the pope instated high ranking clergy
from Rome, barring local clergy. This is also the period of the Avignon
"Babylonian captivity", when popes moved from Rome to southern France. During
this Great Schism, there were sometimes 3 popes. I'd never heard of John
Wycliffe and his followers (known as Lollards) but he was a sort of proto-Martin
Luther, advocating similar reforms to Christian orthodoxy such as a direct
relationship with God and redistribution of church-owned land. He even produced
the Bible translated into vernacular English. This economic and clerical
dissatisfaction led to the Peasant Revolt of 1381, which was the first popular
(as opposed to Baronial) rebellion. It was eventually quelled but did
demonstrate that the king increasingly had to listen to the people. The head tax
was abolished. 

**Richard II** was the grandson of Edward III. Richard's reign was completely
dominated by what is called the Merciless Parliament, which strove to further
curtail the power of the king. In retaliation Richard the second banished many
of its members and denied inheritance to several opposing Lords. Eventually he
was deposed by a new parliament and died in a prison cell in 1400. He was
succeeded by Henry Bolingbrook, who came to reign as **Henry IV**.  He was the first
Lancaster of a long dynasty, eventually leading to the Tudors. His reign was
short, succeeded by his son **Henry V**. 

Henry V's reign was highlighted by successful conquest in France during the
Hundred Years War, most notably, in the battle of Agincourt. This was largely
due to internal divisions in France, but it made Henry V a popular king. His son
and successor **Henry VI** managed to lose all of the English territories in
France.  By then, France was united again, and Henry VI had little interest in
ruling was mentally unstable. The only English territory in France that remained
was Calais, and England held it for the next century. 

Henry VI's death led to a succession dispute between two houses: Lancaster (red
rose) and York (white rose), called the War of the Roses. At first York had the
upper hand. Its leader Ed IV held the reigns until his death, and was succeeded
by his son Edward V, a 12-year-old boy at the time. But his reign did not last
long. Vying for power, Ed V's uncle Richard, invented a lie saying that Ed was a
bastard. This led to a successful propaganda campaign in which Richard III
successfully usurped the throne. But it backfired as most people could see
through the lie. Richard III likely executed his young rivals in the Tower of
London, and he was reviled by the people, often depicted as a hunchback and of
short statue in retrospect. 

**Henry Tudor** was part of the Lancaster faction, and had a claim to the
throne.  His first attempt to take over was thwarted by King Richard III, and he
escaped to Bretagne in France. From there, he eventually amassed an army and met
Richard III in battle. Due to his unpopularity, Richard's armies did not obey
him at a critical moment. Henry Tudor was victorious, the War of the roses was
Won by the Lancasters, and thus begins the Tudor lineage, a long period of
English stability. To cement his position and end the civil war definitively,
Henry VII married Elizabeth of York. He and his son Henry VIII then
systematically eliminated all of the pretenders to the throne, and paved the way
for English supremacy during the Renaissance. 

## Crazy etymological stuff

- The name Easter comes from the pagan holiday Eostre. The apple does not fall
  far from the tree. 
- To liquidate comes from melting of coins and other metallic valuables. Obvious
  in retrospect, never thought of it.
- Tolkien's Shire and modern police Sheriffs both trace back to medieval
  England.
- A farthing comes from the word "fourth", because it's value is 1/4 of a penny.
- The title Earl comes from Ealdorman, rooted in "elder". Crazy!
- Chivalry comes from the French word for horse, cheval. Another obvious in
  retrospect case.
- Heraldry is the study of coats of arms. The connection to newspapers named The
  Herald is present but convoluted.
- The notion of bearing arms used to mean that you had a coat of arms, as an
  indication of status. This sure has morphed over time for sure!

## Interesting thoughts and insights

It remains unclear to me what role Thanes played in 9th century England. Did
they have several shires in their control?

The Domesday book is an impressively early systematic attempt to survey all of
England. It was conducted by William the Conqueror in 1080s. Damn impressive for
the time. 

Apparently the switch from oxen to horses for agriculture happened from the 11th
to 13th centuries, with a surge in commerce. Farmers were no longer subsisting,
but producing extra, which would be sold at markets and fairs. Oxen are stronger
than horses, but do not make very good riding animals. A second order effect of
this switch was a change in the shape of farming fields. Previously, plots were
long and narrow since oxen were very hard to turn. Now plots were much more
variable in shape.

Paxton has a really great discussion on chivalry. This horse culture apparently
was the delineating line between yeomen and elites. Tournaments began as multi
person melee brawls and eventually morphed into formal affairs that we think of
today, with jousting. This tracks the evolution of knights, which were
originally hired mercenaries but ultimately became an upper class, sharing the
table with earls and kings. This upward mobility of knights was greatly enabled
by the church, when it condoned violence in the name of the crusades. Finally,
the culture of heroism and going on crusades had much cache. Vividly, Paxton
retells the story of a blind king of Bohemia charging into battle flanked by his
two companions. He wanted glory in death and found it in Calais. 

Written English temporarily died after the Norman conquest, and was supplanted
by French. This lasted for a while, as the civic elite favored French and the
religious elite favored Latin. Eventually written English made a big return with
prominent works written in it including the Canterbury Tales, which interesting
are about a group of pilgrims making their way to see the Tomb of Thomas
Beckett. (Interestingly, French remained the Lingua Franca of Europe for a
while, with Russia and other latecomers clearly falling under French influence
as late as the 19th century.)

I think roughly speaking, society was ordered like this: serf (indentured
servant), then yeoman (small landowner), then gentry (artisans, merchants), then
knight, lord, and king. Rankings among the clergy still elude me, but an
interesting topic for future reading.

I was struck that many historical "events" lasted much longer than I would have
guessed. The three crusades spanned 3 centuries. The Black Plague ebbed and
flowed also over 3 centuries. This is of course easy to see in retrospect, but
it made me wonder what sorts of 3-century long historical events people of 2500
will remember about us?



Real Estate and Cash Flow

"What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow... And 36 Other
Key Financial Measures, Updated Edition"... What a title!

To be honest, I'm kind of embarrassed to post this here, especially so soon
after The New Father. But, I'll admit, I'm a bit spooked by the markets lately.
While indexing has worked well so far, it feels risky, and I'd probably be wise
to diversify. Hence this book.

The book makes two things crystal clear: 

1. "Investors don’t decide to buy properties; they decide to buy the income
   streams of the properties."
2. The importance of discount rate in doing these various calculations, or as
   the author usually descibes it, "the time value of money". A meta thought
   about discount rate. It seems to be a proxy for selfishness. In the
   self-interested case (maximize profit through real estate), you really want a
   high discount rate, but in the long view, say thinking about climate change,
   you think of future generations, and have a pretty low discount rate.

Also, I liked the up-front breakdown of all of the ways in which being a
landlord may be profitable:

1. Cash flow: "You expect to collect money, mainly in the form of rent."
2. Amortization: "You expect to spend money to pay for the operating expenses
   and the loans against the property."
3. Tax shelter: "When you’re done for the year, you hope to have a surplus and
   to keep as much of it as you can in your own pocket and out of the hands of
   the tax collector."
4. Appreciation: "Perhaps someday you can also sell the property at a handsome
   profit."

If I end up attempting to purchase a real estate investment, the book will serve
as a good reference for calculating various terms of the industry (eg. APOD, Cap
rate, CFAT, etc). Honestly, this is really boring stuff, and pretty
straightforward from a calculation perspective. During the case studies
especially, the author meticulously grinds through the numbers, and I could feel
my eyes glazing over.

Oh, before I end this topic, here is an anti-recommendation to a similarly
titled, but much dumber "Rental Property Investing: how to invest in profitable
properties to rent and derive maximum profit from them". Complete drivel. Skip
it.



The New Father

My daughter Elichka is a year old! She's the best, let me show you a picture?
Actually no. Not on the internet.

This book was a trusty reference for me when things got a bit dicey. Rather
than reading daddy or mommy blogs (urgh), a quick look at the relevant age was
sometimes helpful in calming the nerves. I'd recommend it to a new father.


Tribe by Sebastian Junger
===
posted: January 18, 2019
rating: yes

Junger disparages modern western life, and has a very fond attitude towards
traditional hunter-gatherer civilization.

"How do you become an adult in a society that doesn’t ask for sacrifice?" he
asks. "Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel
necessary," he asserts. Modernity provides affluence and safety, but it's
incompatible with freedom and equality. It's easy to spend a day in a modern
society while "surrounded by others and yet feel deeply, dangerously alone."
"As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide
tend to go up rather than down," Junger says. Modernity is fucked, Junger says,
without citing Rousseau. It just ain't natural. Without hardship, you don't
really **need** friends.

On the other hand, Tribal society, while not perfect, was, and let's be honest,
pretty fucking awesome! So awesome, in fact, that "a surprising number of
Americans—mostly men—wound up joining Indian society rather than staying in
their own." I found this surprising, and sadly, there was no citation. You don't
really need to be a hunter gatherer, though. You can just be from Soviet Russia
(this resonated): "Adversity often leads people to depend more on one another,
and that closeness can produce a kind of nostalgia for the hard times that even
civilians are susceptible to." Junger makes the distinction between family and
tribe explicitly: "Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same
as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything
collectively." I thought of the compania.

But even in shitty modernity, if the circumstances are dire enough, people can
still come together and act tribally:

- Male Youth: "They drive too fast, get into fights, haze each other, play
  sports, join fraternities, drink too much, and gamble with their lives in a
  million idiotic ways."

- War: "Emile Durkheim found that when European countries went to war, suicide
  rates dropped."

- Disaster: "social bonds were reinforced during disasters, and that people
  overwhelmingly devoted their energies toward the good of the community rather
  than just themselves."

In the US, soldiers risk a 20 percent chance of PTSD. "they return from wars
that are safer than those their fathers and grandfathers fought, and yet far
greater numbers of them wind up alienated and depressed. This is true even for
people who didn’t experience combat." Remarkably, in Israel, "Despite decades
of intermittent war, the Israel Defense Forces have by some measures a PTSD rate
as low as 1 percent."

Junger thinks that re-entry into American is so difficult because the military
is so close-knit, while modern life is so individualistic. "Soldiers experience
this tribal way of thinking at war, but when they come home they realize that
the tribe they were actually fighting for wasn’t their country, it was their
unit." Compounding the problem is the public's "thank you for your service,"
which rings hollow and reflects a distance from the war itself. Indeed, it's
an ocean away. Further, ever since Vietnam, much of the public has had a
principled disagreement with America's wars.

Junger wants to bring veterans and civilians closer together, to ease
re-integration. "More dignified might be to offer veterans all over the country
the use of their town hall every Veterans Day to speak freely about their
experience at war." Interesting start.

This struck a chord:

> The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but
frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral
extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing,
infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are
mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.

Nodding, I wondered: how disconnected am I? Why don't we go build a [house or a
tractor](https://www.opensourceecology.org/), or maybe learn the answers to some
of [these questions?][11]


12 Rules for Life
===
posted: January 17, 2019
rating: no

One of my rules for life is: listicles are always clickbait, even in book form.
There is a balance to be found between order and chaos. These rules are
Petersons take on where that balance should be. I come at this with a dislike
for Peterson. I first heard him on a Sam Harris podcast and he came off as a
deliberate obscutantist. Also, the pronouns debate seems like a foolish hill to
die on. But when I. told me that he respected Peterson's ideas, I decided to
give the book ago. Spoiler alert: I got through about a third.

Tidbits I found interesting:

- Classical music is a good illustration of fat head distributions / Matthew's
  law / Price's law / Zipf's law. There are not many prominent composers and few
  of their pieces are performed on a regular basis.
- The Yin-yang symbol is actually about chaos and order, masculinity and
  femininity.

Most of Peterson's book is super annoying. Why the emphasis on the dominance
hierarchy? Sure it exists but is it the most fundamental thing about human
existence? After they're also other aspects to life that may be more important?
Peterson's is a classic zero sum framing of life, explicitly so in some places.
Petersons take on the snake as a primordial enemy that coevolved with humans is
a classic just so story. He ties it into Mary and Christ too, for good measure.
It's not credible, but his ability to spin a story is impressive. 

Peterson seems to be writing for an audience of very low self-esteem men. This
is a recipe book for escaping this rut, at worst by becoming a narcissistic
psychopath. By rule four, I'd had my fill and decided to cut my losses.


Building a Bridge to the 18th Century
===
posted: January 11, 2019
rating: no

Neil Postman has strong opinions:

- The 18th century was awesome. 
- Postmodernism is always, unequivocally bad. 
- You don't need typewriters or computers, paper and pen is good enough. 
- People are getting stupider and stupider. 
- Defeating straw man arguments is super fun. 

Postman cites many great thinkers in a way that is clearly erudite. However the
book is rather short and covers a lot of ground, making his name dropping quite
annoying. Rather than delivering deep points, Postman remains on the surface,
hinting at the existence of various philosophical ideas that he is intimately
familiar with. All this while struggling to structure a coherent narrative. 

I found the book mostly useless. It's a shallow summary of some stuff I already
knew, and set forth an exaggerated technological pessimism that I, to some
extent, share. In my most charitable view, Postman's over exaggerated positions
were intended to provoke thought for some hypothetical starry eyed silicon
valley entrepreneurial techno-optimist. Unfortunately, Postman's position is so
extreme and arguments so cliched, I found myself rooting for the other side. 


Infinite Planets
===
posted: January 2, 2019
rating: yes

I've only just touched the tip of the Chinese Sci-Fi iceberg by reading [Three
Body Problem](/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/). So I picked up Infinite Planets, also translated by the same guy, Ken Liu.

Many of the stories were just too out there for me to fully enjoy. I'm not sure
if this is what's meant by "wuxia", but some had a sort of Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon feeling to them: extremely ephemeral, very unpredictable, hard to
understand. I really enjoyed many of the stories, though. Here are my favorites:

**The Fish of Lijiang**: an endearing vignette of fast paced life placed on
pause. Opposites attract in a science fiction cliche kind of way. 

**A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight**: where does reality end and really good
simulation begin?  Emotionally driven, powerful storytelling. Interesting blend
of Chinese folklore with speculative far future robotics/AI. 

**Night Journey of the Dragon Horse**: Memorable sketch of a post apocalypse in
which a sentient robotic dragon horse awakens from a long slumber. 

> "Time flows like a river, halting for no one. There is nothing in the world
that can outlast time itself." 

**Folding Beijing**: Great concept, compelling story. Interesting take on
automation. Also, this served as my introduction to the cynical [Philips
Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips\_curve). If I was to be picky, the
story felt a bit too directly critical of class divisions in modern China for my
taste.

**Taking Care of God**: a parable for aging, intergenerational
misunderstandings, but on a civilizational level. Memorable and bittersweet.
Loved the special relativity explanation for the religious vs. scientific
understanding of Earth's age. Has this been done before?
