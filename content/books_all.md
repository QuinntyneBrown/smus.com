The Circle

The Circle is a thinly veiled parable for, well, Big Tech. At base this book suggests what can happen when high modernism goes too far in the 2010 version of tech. 

In some ways, the book feels dated. Even the most cynical observer today will agree that even Facebook is concerned with privacy, even if mainly to mitigate bad PR. Meanwhile the Circle is unabashedly techno utopian, extremely brash. I bet in 2014 when the book came out, it was culturally truer than it feels today. 

The Circle slogans are especially on the nose: “All that happens must be known”, “To heal we must know. To know we must share.” And PartiRank? Ha! “Secrets are lies, privacy is theft,  sharing is caring”. I think Eggers is going for the 1984 vibe, but it’s just a little over the top.

Mercer’s antler art commodification episode was pretty effective. The whole Instagram influencer business Mae fell into is prescient. I don't think influencers ousting celebrities was as much of a trend at the time of writing. 

Completing the circle feels analogous to building Communism, and a stark reminder that any ideology that tramples over your family and friends is probably bad news. 

I really enjoyed the twist in the end. It was so well done from the moment that “Mae knew what she had to do” to Mae’s supposed aversion of the apocalypse, to the ultimate reveal of whose side she ultimately landed on. Other than the twist, the plot was predictable but immensely addictive anyway. I breezed through this book, but it definitely felt like junk food. Big thanks Mr. P for sending it to me!


Fatherhood in Pieces by Chabon

Collection of essays, from wistful to banal. Nothing that special. But I liked a few vignettes: the one about how each kid costs you a book. And about how baseball is nostalgia, nicely tying three generations of men. 


Smoke and Mirrors by Neil Gaiman

I’ve never read Gaiman before, but his various works have frequented my to-read list. I wasn’t too thrilled by Sandman, but misattributed that feeling to the graphic novel medium. I abandoned this collection midway since the stories were often really boring or weirdly sexual. Even the best ones weren’t especially memorable or original. At first I optimistically found this unevenness appealing, like playing roulette. Half way through, I decided to cut my losses.

One of the better stories was hidden in the introduction, but was basically a riff on Picture of Dorian Gray. I also found “Troll”, “Chivalry”, “Queen of Knives” and “Shoggoth” to be entertaining but not memorable. Other stories were just bad, like “Goldfish Pool”, and “White Road”, and “Changes”.


The Right It (audio)

Cass suggested I check out The Right It by Alberto Savoia. This book is an ode to an idea: do as much as you can to vet an idea before committing a lot of time and energy on it. In other words, become as confident as possible in product-market fit before spending a lot of resources building even the first version. I strongly agree with the sentiment of the book, and have seen product and research teams fail for this exact reason. That said, it’s quite easy to condense into a substantially smaller format, and I might recommend that (if available) rather than reading the entire book.

Most new ventures fail. Savoia encourages founders to be brutally honest with themselves, make their hypotheses explicit and quantified, and then find clever ways to quickly and cheaply validate them. The steps are as follows:

1. Come up with an idea (eg. sell old sushi at a discount).
2. Develop a Market Engagement Hypothesis (eg. A lot of people who want to eat healthy and who like sushi can’t afford to eat it regularly, because sushi tends to be quite expensive. If we can find a way to make sushi as affordable as other fast food, a lot of fast-food patrons will choose sushi over less healthy alternatives.)
3. Quantify (2) with an X% of Y will do Z. (eg. At least 20% of packaged-sushi eaters will try Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)
4. Instantiate (3) with a specific, easily testable idea that gets people to put down money (eg. At least 20% of students buying packaged sushi at Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)
5. Actually run the experiment in (4) using a variety of techniques.
6. Collect your own data from the experiment in (5).
7. Compare the data with your hypothesis. If the results are close to the hypothesis, you are on the right track. If they are way off, might be time to throw in the towel.
8. If things look promising, do a few more runs of (4) - (7).
9. Ultimately make the decision whether to build it, drop it, or make changes to your plan based on what you learned.

Savoia describes a bunch of techniques that may be interesting to apply and riff on:

- Fake door technique: placing a facade of a product and seeing how people engage in it. Will they engage? (eg. A landing page for a website that asks for an email address)
- Pinnochio technique: pretending that a dummy object is actually real (eg. The Palm founder who pretended a block of wood was a PDA)
- Infiltrator technique: negotiate with a store to show your prototype on their shelves for a limited time.

I’ve seen focus groups and traditional user research fail in the exact way that Savoia describes: lack of skin in the game on the part of research participants.
