Hello from the west coast!

My goal is to invent, design, and build novel and delightful user interfaces to
facilitate human flourishing. I prefer working on small, interdisciplinary teams
of designers, engineers, and subject matter experts, iterating quickly, releasing
often, and working in the open. I gravitate to the web platform, but am also
well versed in Android and iOS development, audio and sensor software
engineering, and prototyping at the intersection of hardware and software. My
ideal role involves a mix of UX design, software engineering, and invention.

While on the Google VR team, I created, evangelized and maintained fundamental
WebVR [tools][polyfill] and [libraries][boilerplate]. I was fortunate to be on
the founding team of [Google Cardboard][cardboard], where I invented the
[original input method][cardboard-button].

At Google Research, I created [Google Tone][tone], which reduced the barrier to
sharing locally by sending URLs over audio, as well as many other exciting
prototypes. I also provided technical direction to small teams of software
engineers, and received over twenty patents in the process.

I joined Google as an engineer on the Chrome developer relations team. I helped
launch [Chrome for Android][chrome], [wrote dozens of articles][h5r], [gave
talks to thousands of developers][talks] and released widely used open source
libraries and samples.

I'm passionate about the intersection of web, music, and education. I began by
[writing][wa1] [tutorials][wa2] on the [Web Audio API][wa-api], which eventually
turned into a [short O'Reilly book][wa-book] on the subject, complete with
[usage samples][wa-examples]. I continue to use the API to build browser based
audio applications:

- A [spectrogram][wa-spectrogram] which later became part of the [Chrome Music
  Lab][wa-music-lab].
- [Filter Playground][wa-fp], which I built to better understand digital filters.
- Browser-based [audio][wa-voice] and [machine learning tools][wa-mel].

Prior to Google, I worked at Apple for two years, contributing to iWeb, iWork
and helping start [iWork.com][iwork].

I hold a masters in HCI from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu], where I focused
on social and [wearable computing research][research] and built
[CrowdForge][crowdforge], a system for crowdsourcing complex tasks. 

I am Canadian. I received a BSc (w/ honours) in Mathematics and Computer Science
from the [University of British Columbia][ubc]. 

I was born in Leningrad, RSFSR, and spent my formative years in Vancouver,
Canada.
