Hello from the west coast!

My goal is to invent, design, and build novel and delightful user interfaces to
facilitate human flourishing. I prefer working on small, interdisciplinary teams
of designers, engineers, and subject matter experts, iterating quickly, releasing
often, and working in the open. I gravitate to the web platform, but am also
well versed in Android and iOS development, audio and sensor software
engineering, and prototyping at the intersection of hardware and software. My
ideal role involves a mix of UX design, software engineering, and invention.

I have technical experience in speech interfaces, virtual reality, audio
processing, the web platform, developer tooling, rapid prototyping,
visualization, and user interfaces. I've written popular technical articles and
gave talks to thousands of developers. I have
[published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bIgFmUwAAAAJ&hl=en) many
patents and a few academic papers. I'm a huge supporter of and regular
contributor to [open source projects](https://github.com/borismus/). My main
areas of interest include education, sensors, audio, music, and user interfaces.

I have a Masters in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University,
and a BSc (hon) in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of
British Columbia. I was born in Leningrad, RSFSR, and spent my formative years
in Vancouver, Canada.
