The '''2003 Stanley Cup playoffs''', the  [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) championship, began on April 9, 2003, following the [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03 regular season]]. The playoffs concluded on June 9, 2003, with the [[New Jersey Devils]] defeating the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in seven games. 

The sixteen qualifying teams played [[playoff format|best-of-7]] series in the conference quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. Each conference champion proceeded to the Stanley Cup Finals.

These playoffs marked the first time the [[Minnesota Wild]] qualified, in only their third season in the NHL. The [[Minnesota Wild]], as a 6 seed, made an unlikely advance to the Western Conference Finals as underdogs after being down three games to one in two consecutive rounds.

==== (1) Ottawa Senators vs. (8) New York Islanders ====
The series opened at [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, where New York goaltender [[Garth Snow]] posted a 25-save shutout in a 3–0 victory. Hoping to avoid losing the first two games at home, the Senators returned the favor in Game 2, with goalie [[Patrick Lalime]] posting a 16-save shutout and the Ottawa attack chasing Snow from goal in favor of [[Rick DiPietro]].

Tied, 1–1, the series shifted venue to New York's [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]]. This game featured the first in which both teams scored in the same game, but Ottawa won the game 2:25 into double overtime, 3–2, on a [[Todd White]] goal, his second of the game. This loss hurt the Islanders' morale, and Ottawa took advantage with a 3–1 Game 4 victory, scoring two first-period goals to take the Islanders out of it early. Ottawa closed out the series the next night back at home, winning the game and the series, 4–1.

==== (2) New Jersey Devils vs. (7) Boston Bruins ====
The series opened at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] in New Jersey, and Game 1 was a defensive battle in an ultimate 2–1 Devils victory behind two goals from [[Jamie Langenbrunner]]. New Jersey then took control of the series with a Game 2, 4–2 victory.

Down 2–0 in the series but heading home to [[TD Garden|FleetCenter]], Boston shook things up, replacing [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]], who allowed six goals in the first two games, in favor of [[Jeff Hackett]]. The shakeup did not do much, as the Devils shut out in the Bruins in Game 3, 3–0, with goalie [[Martin Brodeur]] stopping all 29 shots he faced. Not wanting to end their season with a winless postseason and a loss in front of their fans, Boston came out firing in Game 4, winning the game, 5–1, and knocking out Brodeur after the fifth goal in favor of [[Corey Schwab]], who went 6-for-6 in net. 

Unfortunately for the Bruins and their fans, they had only "stayed their execution" until Game 5 in New Jersey, where Brodeur bounced back from his horrid Game 4 with a 28-save shutout in a 3–0 win as Langenbrunner added two more goals.

==== (3) Tampa Bay Lightning vs. (6) Washington Capitals ====
The series opened at [[St. Pete Times Forum]] in Tampa, and the Lightning offense ran into a brick wall in net, as Washington goalie [[Olaf Kolzig]] stopped all 28 shots he faced in a 3–0 victory. Game 2 saw Tampa take 43 shots on net, a sign that Washington's defense softened, but Washington shelled Lightning goalie [[Nikolai Khabibulin]] in a 6–3 victory, including two goals apiece from [[Peter Bondra]] and [[Jaromír Jágr]]. Tampa Bay was in trouble: they had to win four out of the next five games, with three at Washington's [[MCI Center]].

Washington returned home to a raucous home crowd, buoyed by their success in Florida. The Lightning eked out a must-win in Game 3, a 4–3 victory when [[Vincent Lecavalier]] scored the game-winner 2:29 into overtime. In Game 4, Tampa Bay stole the momentum headed back home in a 3–1 victory. The Capitals now saw themselves in trouble: they had no momentum, and two of the next three games were in Florida. Tampa posted a 2–1 victory in Game 5 to push the Capitals to the brink. Game 6 in Washington went to overtime as the Capitals tried to hang on to force a Game 7, and neither team gave an inch as the game went to triple-overtime. Finally, [[Martin St. Louis]] ended the game and the series 4:03 in. Tampa Bay goalie Khabibulin faced a whopping 61 shots in goal during Game 6.

==== (4) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (5) Toronto Maple Leafs ====
The series opened at [[Wachovia Center]] in Philadelphia, and the goals were plentiful in a 5–3 Toronto victory. Toronto made advantage of their few opportunities: Philadelphia goalie [[Roman Cechmanek]] only faced 14 shots but allowed four goals (the fifth goal was an empty-netter), including a hat trick by [[Alexander Mogilny]]. The Flyers bounced back nicely with a 4–1 Game 2 victory to tie the series, 1–1.

The series shifted venue to [[Air Canada Centre]] in Toronto for Game 3, where the Maple Leafs won in double-overtime, 4–3, on a goal by [[Tomas Kaberle]], his second of the game. Game 4 went even longer, but Philadelphia won the game, 3–2, 13:54 into triple overtime on a goal by [[Mark Recchi]], his second of the game. The series returned to Philadelphia for Game 5, which was a 4–1 Flyers win.

With Toronto facing elimination but playing a home game for Game 6, Toronto pulled out a 2–1, double-overtime victory on a goal by [[Travis Green]] to force a Game 7 in Philadelphia. The Flyers then barraged Toronto goalie [[Ed Belfour]], who allowed six goals in a 6–1 Philadelphia win that sent them to the Conference Semifinals.

=== Western Conference Quarterfinals ===
==== (1) Dallas Stars vs. (8) Edmonton Oilers ====
The series opened at [[American Airlines Center]] in Dallas, and both defenses were strong: Edmonton took 23 shots while Dallas only took 21, but Edmonton won the game, 2–1. Not wanting to fall behind 2–0 going to Edmonton, the Stars' attack shelled Oilers goalie [[Tommy Salo]] in Game 2, a 6–1 Dallas victory highlighted by two goals from [[Scott Young (ice hockey b. 1967)|Scott Young]]. Salo was pulled after the fifth goal in favor of [[Jussi Markkanen]].

The series moved to [[Rexall Place]] in Edmonton, and the Oilers used three third-period goals to win the game, 3–2. Game 4 was a must-win for the Stars, and they came through, winning the game, 3–1. Back in Dallas, the Stars moved a step closer to knocking out the Oilers with a 5–2 victory in Game 5. Dallas delivered the death blow in Game 6, eliminating Edmonton with a 3–2 victory. As of 2010, this was the last time the two teams met in the playoffs.

==== (2) Detroit Red Wings vs. (7) Mighty Ducks of Anaheim ====
The series opened at [[Joe Louis Arena]] in Detroit, and a thrilling triple-overtime battle ensued. The sellout crowd at Joe Louis Arena thought the Wings had won the game thanks to a [[Luc Robitaille]] shot at 9:21. Some of the Detroit players had even left for the dressing room, thinking they had successfully taken a 1-0 series lead. However, after going to video review, it was concluded that Robitaille's shot ricocheted off the crossbar and the post, and the players were brought back to resume the game. Later, at 3:18 into the third overtime period, [[Paul Kariya]] scored the goal that would clinch a 2-1 win for Anaheim and a one game lead in the series. Anaheim goalie [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] faced 64 shots in Game 1. Game 2 featured another close game, but Anaheim pulled out another close victory, this time by a 3–2 count, scoring two third-period goals to erase a 2–1 deficit. Second-seeded Detroit was in trouble, inexplicably struggling with a seventh-seeded but tough Anaheim team.

Game 3, at the [[Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]], was a must-win for the Red Wings, but they dropped another one-goal game, 2–1. The Ducks completed the stunning four-game sweep of the Red Wings, who had missed the top seed in the West by one point, with another one-goal game in Game 4, a 3–2 overtime victory with [[Steve Rucchin]] delivering the knockout goal 6:53 into overtime. With the loss, the Red Wings became only the second defending Stanley Cup champions to be swept the following year in a four-game opening series, the other team being the 1952 Toronto Maple Leafs, who were swept by those same Red Wings. The Red Wings went on to win the Stanley Cup that year.

==== (3) Colorado Avalanche vs. (6) Minnesota Wild ====
The series opened at [[Pepsi Center]] in Denver, but the Wild won a close-fought Game 1, 4–2. Game 2 was closer, but the Avalanche tied the series, 1–1, with a much-needed 3–2 victory. The series then shifted venue to the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in St. Paul for Game 3, and Avalanche goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] posted an 18-save shutout in a 3–0 Colorado victory that gave them the series lead. When Colorado took Game 4, 3–1, the series victory for the Avalanche looked all but certain: they were up in the series, 3–1, and were heading home for two of the next three games. During Game 4, desperate to shake some life into his team, Minnesota coach [[Jacques Lemaire]] inserted [[Emmanuel Fernandez|Manny Fernandez]] into goal after incumbent goalie [[Dwayne Roloson]] allowed two goals to [[Joe Sakic]] in the first eight minutes.

But the Wild hung tough, jumping out to a 3–0 lead and ultimately hanging on to win Game 5 in Denver, 3–2. They then headed home for a tense Game 6. After a scoreless first 40 minutes, each team scored twice in the third period, and the game went to overtime tied, 2–2. Minnesota ended the game when [[Richard Park]] tallied his second goal of the game 4:22 in to force a Game 7 in Denver. In Game 7, the teams again played to a 2–2 tie after 60 minutes, but [[Andrew Brunette]] ended the game and the series 3:25 into overtime to give the Wild the stunning series comeback victory.  This goal was also the last one Hall of Fame goalie [[Patrick Roy]] would give up in his illustrious career, as the goaltender would announce his retirement during the up coming off-season.

==== (4) Vancouver Canucks vs. (5) St. Louis Blues ====
The series opened at [[GM Place]] in Vancouver, where St. Louis scored two goals in each period, rolling to a 6–0 Game 1 victory that saw Blues goalie [[Chris Osgood]] post a 20-save shutout. Game 2 was a different story, however: Canucks goalie [[Dan Cloutier]] recovered from a horrid Game 1 to only allow one goal in a 2–1 Vancouver win that tied the series, 1–1.  Also notable from this game was the loss of Blues captain Al MacInnis to a separated shoulder following a check to the glass behind the Blues net.

Game 3 was held at the [[Savvis Center]] in St. Louis, and Osgood turned in another stellar performance, allowing only one goal in a 3–1 Blues victory. The Blues cranked out more offensive firepower in a 4–1 Game 4 victory that pushed Vancouver to the brink. Vancouver had their work cut out for them: they had to win the next three games, but two of them were at home if the series went that far.

Vancouver, held to just four goals in series up to that point, finally opened up in Game 5, a 5–3 Canucks victory. This game was notable as a number of St. Louis' players became ill with influenza prior to the game and played in a weakened state.  Game 6 saw the Canucks race out to a 4–1 lead and then hang on for 4–3 victory that forced a decisive Game 7 back in Vancouver. With all of their momentum lost, St. Louis allowed four unanswered goals in Game 7 as Vancouver easily won the game, 4–1, and the series, 4–3.  Al MacInnis returned from the shoulder injury suffered in game 2 of this series to try to inspire his team to victory, but he clearly was not at full strength and was a non-factor in the game.

==== (1) Ottawa Senators vs. (4) Philadelphia Flyers ====
The series opened at [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, where the Senators used three second-period goals to win Game 1, 4–2. Game 2 saw Flyers goalie [[Roman Čechmánek|Roman Cechmanek]] post his first shutout of the postseason (33 saves) in a 2–0 Philadelphia victory that tied the series, 1–1.

Game 3 was at the [[Wachovia Center]] in Philadelphia, and Ottawa took the series lead with a 3–2 overtime victory, with [[Wade Redden]] scoring his first goal of the postseason 6:43 in. Cechmanek again came through in Game 4, posting his second shutout of the series as the Flyers won the game, 1–0, on a goal by [[Michal Handzuš|Michal Handzus]]. 

The series returned to Ottawa for Game 5, where the Senators shelled Cechmanek in a 5–2 victory. Game 5 also saw [[Robert Esche]] appear in goal for the Flyers, and he went 13-for-14 after Ottawa's fourth goal. The Senators finished off the job in Game 6 with a 5–1 victory in Philadelphia, with four of the Ottawa scorers in Game 5 turning in a repeat performance.

The series opened at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] in New Jersey, where the Devils scored three third-period goals to break a scoreless tie en route to a 3–0 Game 1 victory with goalie [[Martin Brodeur]] posting a 15-save shutout in the process. Game 2 was a little tenser, with New Jersey rallying from a third-period deficit and winning the game 2:09 into overtime, 3–2, on a goal by [[Jamie Langenbrunner]].

At home at the [[St. Pete Times Forum]] in Tampa, the Lightning jumped out to a 3–0 first-period lead, then watched New Jersey tie the score before scoring in the third period on a goal by [[Dave Andreychuk]] to win the game, 4–3. The Devils responded by winning Game 4, 3–1, to push the Lightning to the brink. The Devils ended the series with a 2–1 triple-overtime victory in Game 5, with [[Grant Marshall]] scoring the game-winning goal 11:12 into the sixth period.

==== (1) Dallas Stars vs. (7) Mighty Ducks of Anaheim ====
The series opened at [[American Airlines Center]] in Dallas, where the heavily-favored Stars and underdog Ducks engaged in an epic battle that took over 140 minutes and four overtimes to decide before Anaheim's [[Petr Sýkora|Petr Sykora]] scored the game-winner 47 seconds into the ''fifth'' overtime, winning the game for the Ducks, 4–3. Dallas goalie [[Marty Turco]] saw 54 shots while Anaheim's goalie, [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]], saw 63. It was the fourth longest playoff game in NHL history. Game 2 saw another game tied after 60 minutes, but this time, Anaheim needed only 1:44 to win the game in the first overtime, 3–2, on a goal by [[Mike Leclerc]]. Dallas, much like Detroit in its first-round series against the Ducks, faced a 2–0 deficit headed to Anaheim.

Game 3 at [[Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]] was a must-win for the Stars, and they came through, winning the game, 2–1, getting two clutch goals from [[Jere Lehtinen]]. But the Ducks refused to let the Stars back in the series, winning Game 4, 1–0, behind a 28-save shutout from Giguere. Not wanting to be eliminated in front of their home fans, a motivated Dallas team captured Game 5, 4–1. Unfortunately for the Stars, their bid to take the series to a Game 7 was denied when they were edged in Game 6, 4–3.

==== (4) Vancouver Canucks vs. (6) Minnesota Wild ====
The series opened at [[GM Place]] in Vancouver, where the Canucks took Game 1 in overtime, 4–3, on a game-winning power-play goal by [[Trent Klatt]] 3:42 in. They had forced overtime with [[Matt Cooke]]'s tying goal with 2.3 seconds remaining in regulation time.  The Wild rebounded in Game 2 with a 3–2 victory that tied the series, 1–1. The series shifted venue to the [[Xcel Energy Center]] for Game 3, in which the Canucks won, 3–2. With a 3–2 overtime victory in Game 4, the fourth consecutive one-goal game of the series, Vancouver was poised to eliminate Minnesota, up in the series 3–1 with two of the next three games at home.

But this scenario was nothing new to the Wild; they had eliminated the third-seeded Avalanche in seven games in the first round after losing three of the first four. And, like the first round, they had to go on the road for Games 5 and 7. In what appeared to be a case of [[Déjà vu]], Minnesota coach [[Jacques Lemaire]] changed goalies again, this time re-inserting [[Dwayne Roloson]], who replaced an ineffective [[Emmanuel Fernandez|Manny Fernandez]].

In Game 5, back in Vancouver, the Wild annihilated Canucks goalie [[Dan Cloutier]], who went 15-for-21 in saves and was knocked out in favor of [[Alex Auld]], who went 4-for-5. Minnesota's goal spurt came in the second period, when they scored five goals en route to a 7–2 victory. Spurred on by their thrashing of the Canucks in Game 5, the Wild came out at home in Game 6, scoring three third-period goals en route to a 5–1 victory that forced a Game 7. After their blowout losses in Games 5 and 6, the Canucks returned home and built up a 2–0 second period lead before collapsing as the Wild won Game 7, 4–2.  

The Wild are the only team to date that has come back from two 3–1 deficits in the same NHL postseason.

==== (1) Ottawa Senators vs. (2) New Jersey Devils ====
The series opened at [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, where the Senators took Game 1 in overtime, 3–2, when [[Shaun Van Allen]] tipped in a pass from [[Martin Havlát]] 3:08 into overtime. New Jersey tied the series, 1–1, with a crucial victory in Game 2, 4–1. It marked the first time Ottawa goalie [[Patrick Lalime]] allowed more than two goals in twelve postseason games.

Game 3 at the [[Continental Airlines Arena]] in New Jersey saw an amazing defensive battle, but New Jersey won the game, 1–0, on a first-period goal by [[Sergei Brylin]]. [[Martin Brodeur]] posted a 24-save shutout for the Devils in the process. New Jersey appeared to have the series in control when they broke a 2–2 tie in Game 4 with three third-period goals en route to a 5–2 win, and they led in the series, 3–1. But, it wasn't over yet, as Minnesota (twice) and Vancouver rebounded from 3–1 series deficits earlier in the playoffs.

Ottawa returned home for Game 5, not wanting to lose in front of their fans. They staved off elimination with a 3–1 victory. The tense action resumed back in New Jersey for Game 6, as the teams entered overtime tied, 1–1, and all the Devils needed was a goal to knock out the Senators. The death blow did not come in Game 6, as [[Chris Phillips]] scored the game-winning goal 15:52 into overtime in the 2–1 Senators victory.

Determined not to suffer the same misfortunes as Colorado, St. Louis, and Vancouver, the Devils broke through in Game 7, winning the game, 3–2, as [[Jeff Friesen]] knocked in the series-winning goal with just over two minutes to play to send New Jersey to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the decisive game, the Devils benefited from a two-goal performance by [[Jamie Langenbrunner]], his first goals of the series.

==== (6) Minnesota Wild vs. (7) Mighty Ducks of Anaheim ====
The series opened at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in Minnesota, and both teams ground it out down to the game-winning score, which came from [[Petr Sýkora|Petr Sykora]] 8:06 into double-overtime in a 1–0 Mighty Ducks victory. [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] turned in a stellar performance in net for Anaheim, stopping all 39 shots he faced. With [[Dwayne Roloson]] replacing [[Emmanuel Fernandez|Manny Fernandez]] in net for the Wild, Game 2 was just as close, but the Ducks pulled out a 2–0 victory, both goals short-handed, as Giguere stopped all 24 shots he faced, making him 63-for-63 in the series. Minnesota was in trouble; not only were they down in the series, 2–0, headed to Anaheim, but they had yet to score a goal.

Out at the [[Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]] for Game 3, Giguere continued his goaltending excellency, stopping all 35 shots he faced in a 4–0 Mighty Ducks victory that pushed the Wild to the brink. Giguere had now stopped the first 98 shots he saw in the series. In Game 3, [[Paul Kariya]] tallied two goals to help the Anaheim attack. Minnesota, demoralized at their offensive impotence, lost Game 4, 2–1, but at least they avoided a fourth consecutive shutout, as [[Andrew Brunette]] scored the first Minnesota goal of the series 4:37 into the game. Still, Giguere was 122-for-123 in the series, a robust .992 save percentage. [[Adam Oates]] scored both Anaheim goals, the decisive one coming midway through the second period.
