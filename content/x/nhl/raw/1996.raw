The '''1996 Stanley Cup playoffs''', the championship of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), began in April, [[1996 in sports|1996]]. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-7 series]] for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, and then the conference champions  played a best-of-7 series for the [[Stanley Cup]]. These playoffs are noted as being the first playoffs in which all Canadian teams are eliminated after the first round. The New Jersey Devils, who had won the cup the year before, missed these playoffs. All 3 California based teams, The San Jose Sharks, Los Angeles Kings, and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim missed the playoffs.

The playoffs ended in June with the [[Colorado Avalanche]] sweeping the [[Florida Panthers]] in both team's first ever Finals appearance. It was Colorado's first ever Stanley Cup championship. In the previous years, they were known as the [[Quebec Nordiques]]. [[Joe Sakic]] was named playoff MVP, and awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]].

The 1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs is the most recent year that every [[Original Six]] team has advanced to the playoffs in the same year. Since current playoff format was implemented in [[1994]], this has only happened twice: in 1994 and 1996.

==Eastern Conference Final==
The '''1996 Eastern Conference Final''' was the [[National Hockey League]] [[best-of-seven playoff]] series between the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and [[Florida Panthers]]. The [[Florida Panthers]] won the series in seven games, and represented the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|NHL Eastern Conference]] in the [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals]].

=== Series background ===
The [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins]] were coming off a dominating 5-game series win over the [[New York Rangers]], while the [[Florida Panthers|Panthers]] had just completed an unlikely [[upset]] of the top-seeded [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. The Penguins were looking to advance to the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time since 1992, while the Panthers were playing in their first-ever Conference Finals.

=== Series game recaps ===
Despite being outshot 33–25 in game one at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, the Panthers came out on top with an impressive 5–1 win. Florida goaltender [[John Vanbiesbrouck]] made 32 [[Save (ice hockey)|saves]] and Florida forward [[Tom Fitzgerald (hockey)|Tom Fitzgerald]] scored twice.

The Penguins, wanting to avoid going down 2–0 against the Panthers, came out with a better game two and won 3–2.

In game three at the [[Miami Arena]], the Panthers fired an incredible 61 shots on Penguins goaltender [[Tom Barrasso]] and it paid off as the Panthers won 5–2 to take a two-games-to-one series lead. Florida forward [[Stu Barnes]] scored twice.

Then, trailing 1–0 in game four, Pittsburgh tied the score on [[Brad Lauer]]'s goal with 11:03 remaining in regulation. [[Bryan Smolinski]] scored the go-ahead goal with 3:31 to go to give the Penguins a 2–1 lead. This turned out to be the game-winner, as Pittsburgh hung on to win the game 2–1 and tie the series at two games apiece.

In game five back at the [[Mellon Arena|Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh]], the Penguins shut out the Panthers 3–0. [[Tom Barrasso]] stopped all 28 Florida shots he faced.

Leading the series three games to two, Pittsburgh looked to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals in game six on Thursday, May 30 at the Miami Arena. The Penguins led 2–1 in the second period, but the Panthers scored three of the next four goals and edged the Penguins 4–3 to tie the series at 3–3.

The pivotal game seven on Saturday, June 1 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, Florida got a 1–0 lead on [[Mike Hough]]'s goal at 13:13 of the first period. After a scoreless second period, Pittsburgh tied the game on [[Petr Nedvěd|Petr Nedved]]'s power-play goal at 1:23 of the third period. However, the Panthers regained the lead on [[Tom Fitzgerald (ice hockey)|Tom Fitzgerald]]'s bizarre 58-foot slapshot at 6:18 and got an insurance goal from [[Johan Garpenlöv]] at 17:23. Florida hung on to win the game 3–1 and the series four games to three. [[John Vanbiesbrouck]] made 39 saves in the victory.

==Western Conference Final==
The '''1996 Western Conference Final''' was the [[National Hockey League]] [[best-of-seven playoff]] series between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Colorado Avalanche]]. The [[Colorado Avalanche]] won the series in six games, and represented the [[Western Conference (NHL)|NHL Western Conference]] in the [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals]].

=== Series background ===
The [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]] had just finished a seven-game series win against the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], while the [[Colorado Avalanche|Avalanche]] were coming off a six-game series win against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Detroit had the league's best regular-season record and were hoping to advance to the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] for the second consecutive year. As a franchise, the Avalanche had not been in a Conference Finals since 1985, when they were the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and a member of the [[Prince of Wales Conference]] (now the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|NHL Eastern Conference]]), and were looking to advance to the Cup Finals for the first time ever.

=== Series game recaps ===
As expected, game one at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]] was a hard-fought battle. The score was tied 2–2 in the first overtime period when [[Mike Keane]] scored at 17:31 to give Colorado a 3–2 win.

The Avalanche won game two as well, 3–0. Colorado goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] stopped all 35 shots he faced.

Down two games to none, the Red Wings played solidly in game three at [[McNichols Sports Arena]] in [[Denver]]. Detroit defensemen [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]] and [[Vladimir Konstantinov]] combined to score three goals (including a shorthanded goal by Konstantinov) and Detroit won 6–4.

In Game 4, the Red Wings outshot the Avalanche 31–17. However, Colorado won the game 4–2, thanks in part to 29 saves made by goaltender [[Patrick Roy]]. The Avalanche now had a three-games-to-one lead in the series.

Detroit played with desperation and determination in Game 5 at the Joe Louis Arena on Monday, May 27. Inspired by [[Vladimir Konstantinov]]'s big body check on Avalanche forward Claude Lemieux, the Red Wings went on to win 5–2. The series now stood at three games to two in favor of Colorado.

Game 6 at [[McNichols Sports Arena]] on Wednesday, May 29, became famous in the history of the [[National_Hockey_League_rivalries#Avalanche-Red_Wings_rivalry|Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry]]. At one moment during that game, Detroit forward [[Kris Draper]] was along the boards at center ice, off balance, when Colorado forward [[Claude Lemieux]] checked Draper into the boards. The hit sent Draper to the hospital with a broken jaw and a shattered cheek and orbital bone, which required surgery and stitches. Draper did not return to play until the middle of the 1996–97 season. While Lemieux was assessed a five minute major penalty and a game misconduct match penalty for the hit<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDClip=15111&IDCat=274&IDCatPa=153 1996: Rogue Claude clips Draper's Wings - CBC Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, the Avalanche went on to win the game 4–1, and the series four games to two. The controversial hit on Draper by Lemieux started the Detroit-Colorado rivalry that lasted for years.
