[[File:2008StanleyCupPlayoffs.png|right|thumb|240px|Official logo for the 2008 NHL Stanley Cup playoffs.]]
The '''2008 Stanley Cup playoffs''' of the [[National Hockey League]] began on April 9, 2008, after the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 regular season]]. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-7 series]] for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, and then the conference champions played a best-of-7 series for the [[Stanley Cup]].

The Finals ended on June 4, 2008, with the [[Detroit Red Wings]] defeating the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] four games to two to win their eleventh championship and their fourth in eleven seasons. It was the first championship in the 16 year career of Red Wings winger [[Dallas Drake]], who retired following the season. Red Wings winger [[Henrik Zetterberg]] was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the playoff's Most Valuable Player. Sidney Crosby and Henrik Zetteberg both led the tournament with 27 points.

==Highlights==
The [[San Jose Sharks]] were the media's favorite to win the cup going into the playoffs, having gone the entire month of March without a regulation loss and nearly finishing first overall during the regular season.

===Milestones===
In game one of the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the [[Minnesota Wild]], captain [[Joe Sakic]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] extended his record for playoff overtime goals to 8, with a goal 11:11 into overtime.  [[Chris Chelios]] of the Detroit Red Wings appeared in his 248th career playoff game, passing [[Patrick Roy]] for most career playoff games of all-time.

In game two of the Western Conference Semifinals in San Jose, [[Dallas Stars]]' center [[Brad Richards]] tied an NHL record for most points in one period of a playoff game, when he recorded one goal and three assists in the third period.

In the Western Conference Semifinals against the Colorado Avalanche, [[Johan Franzén|Johan Franzen]] became the first player to score multiple hat tricks in a series since [[Jari Kurri]] had three in 1985. In the process, he set an NHL record for most goals in a four-game sweep and the Detroit Red Wings record for most goals in a playoff series with 9, beating the previous record of 8 set by [[Gordie Howe]] in 1949.<ref name="Franzen record">[http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2007030234 Game Recap] of Game 4 of the Detroit-Colorado Western Conference Semifinals.</ref> Franzen achieved this feat in only four games, while Howe achieved it in seven.<ref name="Franzen record" />

Game six of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Sharks and Stars was the eighth longest game in the history of the NHL, lasting 129:03.  Stars' captain [[Brenden Morrow]] ended the game at 9:03 of the fourth overtime tapping in a power play goal.  Goalies Marty Turco and Evgeni Nabokov set team records for saves in a game with 61 and 53 respectively.  The final score was 2–1.

[[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]] became the first team captain born and trained in Europe whose team won the [[Stanley Cup]]. [[Charlie Gardiner (ice hockey)|Charlie Gardiner]] (born in Scotland) and [[Johnny Gottselig]] (born in Russia) both won the Stanley Cup as captains of the Chicago Blackhawks(in [[1934 Stanley Cup Finals|1934]] and [[1938 Stanley Cup Finals|1938]], respectively), but they were both raised in Canada.

===New interpretation of NHL rule===
In game three of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, while on a 5-on-3 powerplay, the [[New York Rangers]]' [[Sean Avery]] tried to screen the [[New Jersey Devils]]' goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] by waving his hands and stick while facing Brodeur. This prompted the NHL to issue an interpretation of the league's rules, stating that an unsportsmanlike conduct minor penalty will be called on actions such as the one used by Avery.<ref name="ESPNAmendedRule">{{cite news| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2008/news/story?id=3346729 | title=NHL amends unsportsmanlike conduct rule in response to Avery's antics | publisher=[[ESPN.com]] | date=2008-04-14 | accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>

==Playoff seeds==
After the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 NHL regular season]], the standard of 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The [[Detroit Red Wings]] were the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] regular season champions and were also the [[Presidents' Trophy]] winners with the best record at 115 points.  The [[Montreal Canadiens]] earned the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] regular season crown with 104 points.

}}
In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage, which gives them a possible maximum of four games on their home ice, with the lower-seeded team getting a possible maximum of three. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points; thus, the Detroit Red Wings had home ice advantage throughout the playoffs, including in the Finals. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format. This means that the higher-seeded team will have home ice for Games 1 and 2, and if necessary, Games 5 and 7, while the lower-seeded team will have home ice for Games 3, 4, and, if necessary, Game 6.

== Conference Quarterfinals ==
=== Eastern Conference Quarterfinals ===
==== (1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (8) Boston Bruins ====
Going into the playoffs, expectations were high for the [[Montreal Canadiens]], since they had won all eight games against the [[Boston Bruins]] during the 2007–08 season and the last three games of the previous season. Additionally, Montreal ended the regular season going 8–1–1 while Boston had a mediocre finish with 4–2–4. One potential disadvantage for Montreal was the inexperience of their young goaltenders: [[Carey Price]], age 20, had only played 41 NHL games, and [[Jaroslav Halák|Jaroslav Halak]], age 23, had only played 16 NHL games. Neither Price nor Halak had any NHL playoff experience. However, Boston's [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]] had only played 165 career NHL games, and he also had no NHL playoff experience.

A strong performance in Game 1 reinforced the idea of a quick win for Montreal. The Bruins also lost Game 2 but demonstrated strong play throughout the game, culminating in two third period goals to take the game into overtime, where they quickly lost.

Boston won Game 3 in overtime, ending the 13-game winning streak that Montreal had accumulated against the Bruins. The tight competition continued into Game 4, with Canadiens goaltender Carey Price notching his first playoff shutout in a 1–0 win.

After two periods in Game 5, with the score 1–1, the game looked as though it would be another close battle. However, a mishandling of the puck by Carey Price early in the third period resulted in a goal for [[Glen Metropolit]]; this ended up being a turning point in the game; Boston followed up with three more goals in the period to win 5–1. The Bruins also won Game 6 in a high scoring match to tie the series at 3–3.

In Game 7, Montreal rebounded from the lackluster performances of its previous games and won with a dominant and convincing 5–0 win, resulting in Price's second career playoff shutout.

==== (2) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (7) Ottawa Senators ====
The Pittsburgh Penguins entered the playoffs as the second overall seed in the Eastern Conference, having clinched the Atlantic Division title with 102 points. Meanwhile, the Senators limped into the playoffs as the seventh seed, with key players out with injuries, including captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] who missed the first two games.

The Penguins dominated the Senators in Game 1, winning by a score of 4-0. The Penguins then held on for a 5-3 win in Game 2, taking a 2-0 series advantage. The Senators were hoping to gain momentum when the series shifted to Ottawa for Games 3 and 4, but the Penguins would not relent. Sidney Crosby's goal in the opening seconds of the third period of Game 3 broke a 1-1 tie, and Pittsburgh eventually won 4-1, and then completed the series sweep in Game 4 with a 3-1 win. [[Sidney Crosby]] led the Penguins with 8 points (2 goals and 6 assists).

Tension was high in this series, as the Rangers won 7 of the 8 games against their [[Devils–Rangers rivalry|rivals across the Hudson River]] during the regular season. The [[New York Rangers]] mostly dominated the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the opening round, becoming the first team to win on New Jersey's home ice three times in a playoff series.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lundqvist stops penalty shot, Rangers hold on to eliminate Devils | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=280418011 | publisher=AP/ESPN.com | date=2008-04-18 | accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> The Devils' only win was an overtime victory in Game 3 with a goal by [[John Madden (ice hockey)|John Madden]]. In Game 3, the Rangers' [[Sean Avery]] tried to screen New Jersey's goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] by waving his hands and stick while facing Brodeur. This prompted the NHL to issue an interpretation of the league's rules, stating that an unsportsmanlike conduct minor penalty will be called on actions such as the one used by Avery.<ref name="ESPNAmendedRule"/> The Rangers won the next two games, each by a score of 5-3 to move on to the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals.

=== Western Conference Quarterfinals ===
==== (1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (8) Nashville Predators ====
The [[Detroit Red Wings]] began the playoffs as the [[President's Trophy]] winners as the highest seed in the NHL, while the [[Nashville Predators]] had battled for a playoff spot, clinching a spot in the final days of the regular season. It was the second-ever playoff matchup between the two teams, with the Red Wings winning the first in 2004 in six games.

The Red Wings won each of the first two games at home 3-1 and 4-2 respectively, but when the series shifted to Nashville for Games 3 and 4, the Predators battled back to tie the series at two games apiece. [[Jason Arnott]] scored the winning goal in Game 3, with [[Greg de Vries]] scoring the winner in Game 4. The turning point in the series came when Red Wings starting goaltender [[Dominik Hašek|Dominik Hasek]] was replaced by [[Chris Osgood]] in the middle of Game 4. Osgood was then named the starter for the remainder of the series. Detroit won Game 5 thanks to an overtime goal from [[Johan Franzén|Johan Franzen]], and then shut out the Predators 3-0 in Game 6 in Nashville to take the series in six games, advancing to the second round.

==== (2) San Jose Sharks vs. (7) Calgary Flames ====
San Jose came into the series as Stanley Cup favorites and the hottest team in the NHL, while the Flames were considered the underdogs. Calgary won Game 1 in San Jose, thanks to two goals by [[Stephane Yelle]] and two assists from [[Jarome Iginla]], before San Jose goaltender [[Evgeni Nabokov]] recorded a shutout in Game 2 to help the Sharks tie the series. The Flames then rallied from a three-goal deficit to earn a Game 3 victory thanks to backup goaltender [[Curtis Joseph]]'s strong performance in relief of [[Miikka Kiprusoff]], and appeared to be on their way to a Game 4 win as well, but the Sharks scored two goals late in the third period to win the game and tie the series. San Jose jumped again to a three-goal lead and held off a Calgary comeback in Game 5, but Miikka Kiprusoff recorded his own shutout in Game 6 to force a deciding Game 7 as the Flames won, 2-0. Unfortunately for the Flames, veteran [[Jeremy Roenick]] had something to prove in these playoffs and exploded in game 7, scoring 2 goals to go along with 2 assists as the Sharks won 5-3; Roenick was named the game's first Star. Curtis Joseph made his second appearance in the series, once again relieving Kiprusoff. Jarome  Iginla and the Flames failed to get past the first round for the third time in three years after playing in the Stanley Cup Finals in 2004.

==== (4) Anaheim Ducks vs. (5) Dallas Stars ====

The defending Stanley Cup champion [[Anaheim Ducks]] came into the 2008 playoffs finishing second in the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] behind the [[San Jose Sharks]], and they were slotted as the fourth seed in the West facing the fifth seeded [[Dallas Stars]] in the opening round.  Despite winning five of eight games against the Ducks during the regular season, the Stars had lost their last two matchups and only collected six total points in the month of March (out of a possible 22 points).  Consequently, the defending champions were heavy favorites against the Stars, who had not made it out of the first round in over five years.

Dallas stunned the undisciplined Ducks, posting a 4–0 shutout in Game 1, with all four goals coming on the [[powerplay]].  Anaheim went into in Game 2 with a much more focused attack but could only manage a 2–2 tie after two periods. Dallas then took control of the series, getting three goals in the third period.

The series shifted to Dallas with the Stars having a 2–0 series lead. In Game 3, the Ducks avoided a 3–0 deficit by taking control early in the game and jumping out to a 4–0 lead, with two goals coming from Ducks captain [[Chris Pronger]].  Anaheim won the game, 4–2.  Anaheim's leading goal scorer in the regular season, [[Corey Perry]], returned from injury in Game 4. However, the Ducks could not keep up with the Stars' [[home advantage|home-ice advantage]], and scored their only goal of the game with eight seconds left.  Dallas won the game 3–1 and took a commanding 3–1 series lead.

Game 5 returned to Anaheim—where the Stars had already won the first two games of the series—as the Ducks attempted to avoid elimination.  The Stars kept it close, but the Ducks took control late in the game, getting their first contributions of the series from Perry. The Ducks won 5–2 to send the series back to Dallas.  In Dallas, the Ducks struck first, getting another goal from Perry, but the Stars scored four goals in the third period with defenseman [[Stephane Robidas]] scoring a goal and then setting up [[Stu Barnes]] for the game winner just one minute later to give the Stars the series win.

==Conference semifinals==
===Eastern Conference Semifinals===
====(1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (6) Philadelphia Flyers====
The Philadelphia Flyers won four consecutive games to eliminate the Eastern Conference top seeded Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens took Game 1 with [[Tom Kostopoulos]]'s goal in overtime, but then had a hard time getting past Flyers goaltender [[Martin Biron]] for the rest of the series. Montreal goaltender [[Carey Price]] started to struggle with the Flyers, and was replaced by [[Jaroslav Halák|Jaroslav Halak]] late in Game 3. Price regained his starting job in Game 5, and the Canadians jumped to a 3–1 lead early in the second period, but the Flyers scored three consecutive goals en route to a 6–4 series clinching victory.

====(2) San Jose Sharks vs. (5) Dallas Stars====
Dallas opened the series having not lost in regulation to the Sharks in San Jose since 2006, however, as in the Anaheim series, the Stars were seeded lower than the Sharks, who had home ice advantage.

Game 1 went to overtime after a late goal by [[Jonathan Cheechoo]] which tied the game, but Dallas captain [[Brenden Morrow]] scored in overtime to finish the game at 3–2. In Game 2, [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] [[Sergei Zubov]] returned from a hernia injury that had kept him out since January. Stars' center [[Brad Richards]] keyed a four goal outburst in the third period for Dallas, scoring a goal and three assists to lead The Stars to a 5–2 win. The Stars became only the fifth team in NHL history to win games 1 and 2 on the road in back to back series in the playoffs. In Game 3 in Dallas, the Stars won again in overtime on a rare goal from defenceman [[Mattias Norstrom]].

With the Stars leading the Sharks 3–0 in the series, San Jose fought off elimination with third period goals from [[Patrick Marleau]] and [[Milan Michalek]] in Game 4. San Jose came back home for Game 5. Dallas took a two goal lead into the third period, however, the Sharks tied the game with goals by Michalek and [[Brian Campbell]]. Overtime was needed for the third time in five games, but just 1:05 into the first overtime, San Jose center [[Joe Pavelski]] converted a turnover to keep the Sharks alive in the playoffs down 3–2. Brenden Morrow had two goals disallowed in the game for illegally kicking the puck into the net and bunting one in with his hand.

In Game 6, Stars right wing [[Antti Miettinen]] opened the scoring in the second period off a rebound from [[Mike Modano]].  Minutes into the third period, San Jose winger [[Ryane Clowe]] tied the game on an odd shot from the [[Hockey rink#Half boards|halfboards]].  Replay showed the puck appeared to have been played with an illegal hand pass.  Stars goaltender [[Marty Turco]] protested, but no official review took place, and the goal was allowed to stand. The game required overtime for the fourth time in the series. The game played on until the early hours of the morning and featured a fantastic goaltending duel between Turco and Sharks' goalie [[Evgeni Nabokov]], each trading spectacular saves throughout all four overtimes.  Just past the 9:00 mark of the fourth overtime, with Brian Campbell in the Sharks' penalty box for tripping, Brenden Morrow tipped home a pass from defenceman [[Stephane Robidas]] to end the [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Longest NHL overtime games|eighth longest game in NHL history]] and win the series for the Stars 4–2.  Goaltenders Turco and Nabokov set team records for saves in a game with 61 and 53 respectively.
