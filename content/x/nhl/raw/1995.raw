The '''1995 Stanley Cup playoffs''', the championship of the [[National Hockey League]] was played between May 6 and June 24, 1995. In the Final, the [[New Jersey Devils]] swept the favored [[Detroit Red Wings]] in four games to win their first championship. The Quebec Nordiques played their last ever playoff series during this time. They would move to Denver, Colorado during the summer.

This was the only time [[Patrick Roy]] missed the playoffs in his career.

The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played best-of-7 series for the conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, and then the conference champions played a best-of-7 series for the [[Stanley Cup]].

The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and [[New Jersey Devils]] met in the 1995 Eastern Conference Final. The Flyers were fresh off their surprising four-game sweep of the defending [[Stanley Cup]]-champion [[New York Rangers]], while the Devils had just completed their unlikely upset of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in five games. The Flyers were looking to get back to the [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time since {{scfy|1987}}, while the Devils were hoping to make it to the Cup Finals for the first time in team history.

[[New Jersey]] shocked [[Philadelphia]] and their home crowd in game one at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]], taking a commanding 3–0 lead after the first two periods. They made it 4–0 on [[Bill Guerin]]'s second goal of the game, at 2:04 of the third period. [[Martin Brodeur]]'s shutout bid was erased, however, as [[Craig MacTavish]] got the Flyers on the board with 1:54 remaining in regulation. The Devils won the game 4–1 to take a 1–0 lead in the series. The Flyers fought back in game two, as [[Mikael Renberg]]'s goal at 13:54 of the first period gave his team a 2–1 lead; its first lead in the series. However, Devils forward [[John MacLean (ice hockey)|John MacLean]] would score with just 12 seconds remaining in the period to tie the game at 2–2. [[New Jersey]] then went on to score three times in the second period, and won the game 5–2. After dominating the first two games at the Spectrum, the Devils headed home for game three, up two games to none in the series. In game three, [[Philadelphia]] played with a sense of urgency. Trailing 2–1, the Flyers tied the game on [[Rod Brind'Amour]]'s goal with 6:03 to go in regulation. They went on to win the game 3–2 on captain [[Eric Lindros]]' goal at 4:19 of the first overtime period. Playing with their newfound confidence, the Flyers won game four as well, 4–2, despite being outshot 34–19. Flyers goaltender [[Ron Hextall]] made 32 saves. The win tied the series at 2–2 and set up a crucial game five on Sunday, June 11 at the Spectrum. The Devils took a 2–1 lead into the second period, which ended up scoreless. The Flyers tied the game on [[Kevin Dineen]]'s second goal of the game at 3:13 of the third period. The Devils almost regained the lead on [[Stephane Richer]]'s breakaway shot that hit the crossbar with less than four minutes to go in regulation. Then, with less than a minute remaining, Devils forward [[Claude Lemieux]] picked up the puck on a backcheck in the [[New Jersey]] zone and skated up the ice. Once over the Flyers' blue line, Lemieux fired a slap shot that beat Hextall blocker side. The goal silenced the Spectrum crowd and gave [[New Jersey]] a 3–2 lead with just 44.2 seconds to play. The Devils hung on to win the game 3–2. 

The Devils were now in the same situation they had been in during the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals the year before]]: going back home to the Meadowlands for game six, leading the series 3-2. In game six on June 13, Philadelphia opened the scoring on [[Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)|Jim Montgomery]]'s goal at 4:05 of the first period. The Devils, however, calmly utilized their neutral-zone Trap to shut down the Flyers' offense while their forwards took advantage. [[Stephane Richer]] tied the game with a power-play goal at 10:25 and [[Brian Rolston]] put the Devils up 2–1 with a goal at 18:15. The scored remained 2–1 for New Jersey until midway through the second period. Flyers forward [[Craig MacTavish]], skating over the Devils' blueline, took a slap shot that was blocked by New Jersey defenceman [[Shawn Chambers]]. At that moment there were four Philadelphia skaters over the blueline. Taking advantage of the situation, New Jersey forward [[Bobby Holik]] picked up the puck after Chambers had blocked the shot and skated up the ice with forward [[Randy McKay]] on the right side and [[Claude Lemieux]] as the trailer. A three-on-one ensued, as only defenceman [[Kevin Haller]] was back. Holik, skating down the ice on the left wing, waited for Haller to commit, which he did. As Haller slid backwards along the ice to take away the pass, Holik feathered the puck under Haller's legs and it went right to [[Randy McKay]]. Flyers goaltender [[Ron Hextall]] was expecting Holik to shoot, so McKay was able to deflect the puck into the net before Hextall moved across to the right side. The goal came at 11:58 and gave New Jersey a 3–1 lead. They made it 4–1 at 10:11 of the third period when [[Bobby Carpenter (ice hockey)|Bobby Carpenter]] passed the puck past Flyers defenceman [[Karl Dykhuis]] up to [[Claude Lemieux]] at center ice who went in on a breakaway and scored his league-leading 11th goal of the playoffs. He had been tied with Pittsburgh's [[Jaromír Jágr|Jaromir Jagr]], who had scored 10 goals in the Penguins' 12 playoff games of 1995. With the goal, Lemieux also broke his personal record for most goals scored in a playoff year that he had set in 1986 as a member of the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. The Flyers fought back as [[Mikael Renberg]] scored on the power play at 16:29 to cut the Devils' lead to 4–2, but New Jersey held its lead and went on to win the game and advance to the [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time in team history. Their trap had held the Flyers to just 16 shots in the game.

The [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] met in the 1995 Western Conference Finals. The Red Wings had just completed a four-game sweep of the [[San Jose Sharks]], and the Blackhawks had just completed their sweep of the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. [[Detroit]] was having its best playoff since 1988, and was hoping to make it to the [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time since {{scfy|1966}}. [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago]], on the other hand, was back in the Conference Finals for the first time since {{scfy|1992}}, when they last made it to the Cup Finals.

Game one of the series at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]] saw a goaltending battle between [[Ed Belfour]] of [[Chicago]] and [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]] of [[Detroit]]. The two teams skated to a 1–1 tie after regulation before [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]] scored the game-winning goal for [[Detroit]] at 1:01 of the first overtime period. It was the first overtime playoff game that Detroit had won at home since Tuesday, March 29, 1960. In game two, [[Chicago]] led by a score of 2–1 after two periods on goals by [[Chris Chelios]] and [[Tony Amonte]]. However, [[Detroit]] kept pressing and eventually tied the game on [[Doug Brown (ice hockey)|Doug Brown]]'s goal. [[Kris Draper]] scored the winner for Detroit with just 1:45 remaining in regulation. In game three of the series at the [[United Center]] in [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]] led 3–2 going into the third period, where [[Jeff Shantz]] scored at 8:33 to tie the game for Chicago. The game went to double overtime where [[Vladimir Konstantinov]] scored the game-winner for Detroit at 9:25. The win gave the Red Wings a commanding three-games-to-none series lead. The Blackhawks responded to the urgency and came out flying in game four. [[Denis Savard]] and [[Joe Murphy (ice hockey)|Joe Murphy]] both scored twice and captain [[Dirk Graham]] had a goal to give [[Chicago]] a dominating 5–0 lead after 40 minutes. [[Detroit]] scored twice in the third period on goals by [[Kris Draper]] and [[Ray Sheppard]], as the Blackhawks went on to win the game 5–2. They now trailed in the series 3 games to 1. In game five in [[Detroit]] on Sunday, June 11, [[Chicago]] jumped out to a 1–0 lead on [[Denis Savard]]'s power play goal at 10:18 of the first period. [[Detroit]] then tied the game on [[Steve Yzerman]]'s goal at 11:36 of the second. After a scoreless third period, the game went into double overtime where [[Vyacheslav Kozlov]] scored at 2:25 to give the Red Wings a 2–1 win and a four-games-to-one series win.
