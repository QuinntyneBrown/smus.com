The '''1968 Stanley Cup playoffs''', to decide the 1968 championship of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was the first after the expansion from six to twelve teams. The defending champion [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] did not qualify and a new champion would be crowned. The [[Montreal Canadiens]] would defeat the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] in four straight to win the [[Stanley Cup]].

==Format==
All of the 'Original Six' teams were placed in the new Eastern Division, and all of the new teams placed in the new Western Division. Each division contributed four playoff teams. Division teams then played off to produce a divisional champion, and the two divisional champions played off in the Final to win the [[Stanley Cup]]

The imbalance between the new teams and old was readily apparent in the standings. All four of the East Division teams had a better record than the top team in the West.

==Series==
The Canadiens drew the third-place Boston Bruins in the first round. The Bruins, making their first appearance in the playoffs since 1959, were swept in four games. In the other East series, the second-place Rangers faced off against the fourth place Chicago Black Hawks. The Black Hawks, led by [[Bobby Hull]] and [[Stan Mikita]] defeated the Rangers in six to set up a Montreal-Chicago East Division showdown. The Black Hawks could not provide another upset, and lost to the Canadiens in five games, giving Montreal their only defeat of the playoffs.

In the West, all four teams played their first playoff series. The first-place [[Philadelphia Flyers]] lost their first-ever playoff series to the Blues, led by goaltender [[Glenn Hall]] and coached by future Hall of Fame coach [[Scotty Bowman]] in seven games, while the second-place [[Los Angeles Kings]] lost to the fourth-place [[Minnesota North Stars]]. The Blues would defeat the North Stars in seven games to advance to their first final.
