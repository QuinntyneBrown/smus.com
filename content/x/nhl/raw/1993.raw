The '''1993 Stanley Cup playoffs''', the championship of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), began at the conclusion of the [[1992–93 NHL season]]  on April 18, and ended with the [[Stanley Cup]] win on June 9. 

This was the first time since the 1979 WHA expansion that the [[Edmonton Oilers]] had missed the playoffs.

This was the first time that [[Mark Messier]] had missed the playoffs in his career.

The [[Montreal Canadiens]] set an NHL playoff record by winning 10 consecutive OT games, 11 consecutive wins total tying the record. 

The [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], who had won the Cup the two previous years, were the favourite to "three-peat". However, the championship went instead to the [[Montreal Canadiens]], who won in a five-game series with the [[Los Angeles Kings]].

==Division semi-finals==
===Adams Division===
====Boston vs. Buffalo====

Buffalo's four-game upset sweep of the heavily-favored Bruins ended with a memorable overtime goal by [[Brad May]] at [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium|Buffalo's Memorial Auditorium]] as they avenged their loss to Boston from the year before.

*April 18 - '''Buffalo 5''' Boston 4 (OT)
*April 20 - '''Buffalo 4''' Boston 0
*April 22 - Boston 3 '''Buffalo 4''' (OT)
*April 24 - Boston 5 '''Buffalo 6''' (OT)

''Buffalo wins best-of-seven series 4–0''

====Quebec vs. Montreal====

Montreal coach [[Jacques Demers]] held himself to a promise he made to goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] earlier in the season and kept him as the starting goalie despite a couple of weak goals allowed in the first two games of the series against the Nordiques. With the Canadiens staring a potential 3–0 series deficit to the rival Nords in the face, overtime in Game 3 was marked by two disputed goals that were reviewed by the video [[Official (ice hockey)|goal judge]]. The first review ruled that [[Stéphan Lebeau|Stephan Lebeau]] had knocked the puck in with a high stick, but the second upheld the Habs' winning goal, as it was directed in by the skate of Quebec defenceman [[Alexei Gusarov]], and not that of a Montreal player. 

As it turned out, this was the final playoff series between the provincial rivals before The Nords moved to Colorado to become the Avalanche.

*April 18 - Montreal 2 '''Quebec 3''' (OT)
*April 20 - Montreal 1 '''Quebec 4'''
*April 22 - Quebec 1 '''Montreal 2''' (OT)
*April 24 - Quebec 2 '''Montreal 3'''
*April 26 - '''Montreal 5''' Quebec 4 (OT)
*April 28 - Quebec 2 '''Montreal 6'''

''Montreal wins best-of-seven series 4–2''

===Patrick Division===
====Pittsburgh vs. New Jersey====

The Devils had been a struggling team prior to the 1992–93 season but qualified for the Patrick Division playoffs for the second consecutive year. Here they met the Presidents' Trophy winners and two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins. With their win in Game 1 the Penguins recorded their twelfth consecutive playoff victory, beating the record the Chicago Blackhawks had set in the 1992 playoffs (and that Pittsburgh had tied in Game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals against those same Blackhawks). The streak ended at 14 when the Devils won Game 4 to stave off elimination.

*April 18 - New Jersey 3 '''Pittsburgh 6'''
*April 20 - New Jersey 0 '''Pittsburgh 7'''
*April 22 - '''Pittsburgh 4''' New Jersey 3
*April 25 - Pittsburgh 1 '''New Jersey 4'''
*April 26 - New Jersey 2 '''Pittsburgh 5'''

''Pittsburgh wins best-of-seven series 4–1''

====Washington vs. New York Islanders====

Game 6 of this series was marred by a vicious check on the Islanders' leading scorer, [[Pierre Turgeon]], by the Capitals' [[Dale Hunter]], moments after Turgeon scored a third-period goal to put the game and the series out of reach for Washington. Turgeon suffered a separated shoulder on the play and missed almost all of the next round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension for the hit, the longest in NHL history up to that time, which was served during the [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94 season]].

*April 18 - New York Islanders 1 '''Washington 3'''
*April 20 - '''New York Islanders 5''' Washington 4 (2OT)
*April 22 - Washington 3 '''New York Islanders 4''' (OT)
*April 24 - Washington 3 '''New York Islanders 4''' (2OT)
*April 26 - New York Islanders 4 '''Washington 6'''
*April 28 - Washington 3 '''New York Islanders 5'''

''NYI win best-of-seven series 4–2''

===Norris Division===
====Chicago vs. St. Louis====
The Blackhawks, on an overtime goal in Game 4, became the second division champion to be swept in the first round of the playoffs. Chicago goaltender [[Ed Belfour]] claimed he had been interfered with by St. Louis star [[Brett Hull]] on the play, but to no avail as the tally stood as the game- and series-winner. Belfour famously went on a rampage after the game, breaking a [[hot tub]], [[Coffeemaker|coffee maker]], and television in the visitors' [[Changeroom|locker room]] at the [[St. Louis Arena]]. In [[1998–99 NHL season|1999]], Hawk fans would be left to contemplate the irony of the situation when Belfour and Hull were teammates on that year's championship team, the [[Dallas Stars]], who in 1993 were known as the [[Minnesota North Stars]]. The Blackhawks, with the sweep, saw their playoff losing streak extended to eight games dating back to 1992.

*April 18 - '''St. Louis 4''' Chicago 3
*April 21 - '''St. Louis 2''' Chicago 0
*April 23 - Chicago 0 '''St. Louis 3'''
*April 25 - Chicago 3 '''St. Louis 4''' (OT)

''St. Louis wins best-of-seven series 4–0''

====Detroit vs. Toronto====
In a revival of the heated [[Original Six]] rivalry, [[Nikolai Borschevsky]]'s Game 7 overtime goal gave Toronto the series and made them the sixth club to eliminate a team with a better regular season record in the first round of the playoffs. This was also Toronto's first playoff win over Detroit since the Leafs beat the Wings in the full seven games back in the [[1963–64 NHL season|1964]] Stanley Cup finals.

*April 19 - Toronto 3 '''Detroit 6'''
*April 21 - Toronto 2 '''Detroit 6'''
*April 23 - Detroit 2 '''Toronto 4'''
*April 25 - Detroit 2 '''Toronto 3'''
*April 27 - '''Toronto 5''' Detroit 4 (OT)
*April 29 - '''Detroit 7''' Toronto 3
*May 1 - '''Toronto 4''' Detroit 3 (OT)

''Toronto wins best-of-seven series 4–3''

===Smythe Division===
====Vancouver vs. Winnipeg====

The [[Smythe Division]] champions from Vancouver managed to shut down the Jets in six games.

*April 19 - Winnipeg 2 '''Vancouver 4'''
*April 21 - Winnipeg 2 '''Vancouver 3'''
*April 23 - Vancouver 4 '''Winnipeg 5'''
*April 25 - '''Vancouver 3''' Winnipeg 1
*April 27 - '''Winnipeg 4''' Vancouver 3 (OT)
*April 29 - '''Vancouver 4''' Winnipeg 3 (OT)

''Vancouver wins best-of-seven series 4–2''

====Calgary vs. Los Angeles====

The Kings upset the Flames in a high-scoring six-game series.

*April 18 - '''Los Angeles 6''' Calgary 3
*April 21 - Los Angeles 4 '''Calgary 9'''
*April 23 - '''Calgary 5''' Los Angeles 2
*April 25 - Calgary 1 '''Los Angeles 3'''
*April 27 - '''Los Angeles 9''' Calgary 4
*April 29 - Calgary 6 '''Los Angeles 9'''

''Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4–2''

==Division finals==
===Adams Division Final: Montreal vs. Buffalo===

The long-awaited series between [[Patrick Roy]] and [[Grant Fuhr]] had finally arrived. However, the Canadiens swept the series, winning every game by a score of 4–3 and winning the Adams Division playoffs. As in their previous series, the Canadiens played three overtime games, this time winning all three.

*May 2 - Buffalo 3 '''Montreal 4'''
*May 4 - Buffalo 3 '''Montreal 4''' (OT)
*May 6 - '''Montreal 4''' Buffalo 3 (OT)
*May 8 - '''Montreal 4''' Buffalo 3 (OT)

''Montreal wins best-of-seven series 4–0''

===Patrick Division Final: Pittsburgh vs. New York Islanders===

The Isles' improbable upset of the defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins, who finished far ahead of New York in the regular season, was capped off by [[David Volek]]'s overtime goal in Game 7. Darius Kasparitus was a big factor in getting Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr off of their games with relentless hits on them throughout the series. The Islanders won the Patrick Division playoffs and advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 1984. To date, this is the last time the Islanders have won a playoff series, as they have been eliminated in the first round in each of their subsequent appearances.

*May 2 - '''New York Islanders 3''' Pittsburgh 2
*May 4 - New York Islanders 0 '''Pittsburgh 3'''
*May 6 - '''Pittsburgh 3''' New York Islanders 1
*May 8 - Pittsburgh 5 '''New York Islanders 6'''
*May 10 - New York Islanders 3 '''Pittsburgh 6'''
*May 12 - Pittsburgh 5 '''New York Islanders 7'''
*May 14 - '''New York Islanders 4''' Pittsburgh 3 (OT)

''New York Islanders win best-of-seven series 4–3''

===Norris Division Final: Toronto vs. St. Louis===
The Maple Leafs defeated the Blues in seven games to win the Norris Division playoffs, despite Blues' goaltender [[Curtis Joseph]]'s efforts. The Blues were heavily outshot throughout the series including more than 60 shots in game one alone. Game 7 was the first to be played at Maple Leaf Gardens since the 1964 Finals when [[Andy Bathgate]] scored the cup clinching goal.

*May 3 - St. Louis 1 '''Toronto 2''' (2OT)
*May 5 - '''St. Louis 2''' Toronto 1 (2OT)
*May 7 - Toronto 3 '''St. Louis 4'''
*May 9 - '''Toronto 4''' St. Louis 1
*May 11 - St. Louis 1 '''Toronto 5'''
*May 13 - Toronto 1 '''St. Louis 2'''
*May 15 - St. Louis 0 '''Toronto 6'''

''Toronto wins best-of-seven series 4–3''

===Smythe Division Final: Vancouver vs. Los Angeles===

Despite Vancouver's huge win in Game 4, Game 5 in Vancouver saw a stoppage of play as Kings forward [[Gary Shuchuk]] got hurt and was sent into the [[Changing Rooms|dressing room]]. Many thought he was out of the playoffs, but he later came back in the game and ended up winning Game 5 in double overtime for the Kings. The Canucks could not recover and thus the Kings advanced to the Campbell Conference finals as the winners of the Smythe Division playoffs.

*May 2 - Los Angeles 2 '''Vancouver 5'''
*May 5 - '''Los Angeles 6''' Vancouver 3
*May 7 - Vancouver 4 '''Los Angeles 7'''
*May 9 - '''Vancouver 7''' Los Angeles 2

*May 13 - Vancouver 3 '''Los Angeles 5'''

''Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4–2''

==Conference finals==
All teams in the Conference finals were seeded third in their division.

===Wales Conference Final: Montreal vs. New York Islanders===

[[Montreal]]'s win in game three was their eleventh straight, tying the single-playoff record set a year earlier by [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Chicago]]. They also added two more overtime victories, bringing their total to seven straight for the playoffs (they lost their first OT game in this year's playoffs), and won the final Wales Conference championship.

*May 16 - New York Islanders 1 '''Montreal 4'''
*May 18 - New York Islanders 3 '''Montreal 4''' (2OT)
*May 20 - '''Montreal 2''' New York Islanders 1 (OT)
*May 22 - Montreal 1 '''New York Islanders 4'''
*May 24 - New York Islanders 2 '''Montreal 5'''

''Montreal wins best-of-seven series 4–1''

===Campbell Conference Final: Toronto vs. Los Angeles===
This conference final was the first one since 1982 not to feature the [[Battle of Alberta|Calgary Flames or the Edmonton Oilers]] representing the Smythe Division. The [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] iced a competitive team for the first time in many years and were hoping to reach the Stanley Cup finals for the first time since their championship in {{scfy|1967}}. The [[Los Angeles Kings]], led by captain [[Wayne Gretzky]], also had high ambitions. Gretzky had never played a postseason game in Toronto prior to the series. During Game 1, Los Angeles blue-liner [[Marty McSorley]] delivered a serious open ice hit on Toronto's [[Doug Gilmour]]. Leafs captain [[Wendel Clark]] took exception to the hit and went after McSorley for striking their star player. Toronto coach [[Pat Burns]] tried scaling the bench to get at Los Angeles coach [[Barry Melrose]] because he thought he ordered the hit on Gilmour (McSorley later remarked in interviews that he received dozens of [[death threat]] messages on his hotel phone from angry fans). Toronto would take a 3–2 series lead after five games. Game 6 was also not without controversy. With the game tied at 4 in overtime, Wayne Gretzky highsticked Doug Gilmour in the face, cutting his chin open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Referee-Kerry-Fraser-addresses-non-call-on-Gretz;_ylt=Av79dVTaIEG9tV62p.kdC3h7vLYF?urn=nhl,181266|title=Referee Kerry Fraser addresses non-call on Gretzky, hair secrets|date=August 6, 2009|first=Sean|last=Leahy|publisher=Yahoo! Sports}}</ref>

Many thought that referee [[Kerry Fraser]] should have called a 5 minute major and a game misconduct (generally given for high sticking penalties that result in a cut at that time) on the play (linesmen can also call penalties for stick infractions, or at least advise the referee that an infraction occurred), but Gretzky was not penalized, and he went on to score the overtime goal moments later, evening the series at 3–3. Toronto would play another game 7 at Maple Leaf Gardens. Gretzky would score three goals and add one assist in the deciding game to give Los Angeles their first Campbell Conference championship and a berth in the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in franchise history. Gretzky has said that his performance in Game 7 was the best NHL game of his career.

*May 19 - '''Los Angeles 3''' Toronto 2
*May 21 - Toronto 2 '''Los Angeles 4'''
*May 23 - '''Toronto 4''' Los Angeles 2

*May 27 - Toronto 4 '''Los Angeles 5''' (OT)
*May 29 - '''Los Angeles 5''' Toronto 4

==Final==
{{main|1993 Stanley Cup Finals}}
This was Montreal's first trip to the Final since 1989. It was Los Angeles' first appearance ever in the Final, and [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s first and only appearance in the Final with the Kings. Montreal would capture their 24th and most recent Stanley Cup championship.
