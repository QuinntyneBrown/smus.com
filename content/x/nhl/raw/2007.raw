The '''2007 Stanley Cup playoffs''' of the [[National Hockey League]] began on April 11, 2007. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-7 series]] for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, and then the conference champions played a best-of-7 series for the [[Stanley Cup]]. The series ended on June 6, 2007, with the [[Anaheim Ducks]] defeating the [[Ottawa Senators]] four games to one to win their first ever championship.

==Playoff seeds==
After the [[2006–07 NHL season]], the standard of 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] were the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] regular season champions and were also the [[Presidents' Trophy]] winners with the best record at 113 points (53 wins, 22 regulation losses, 7 overtime/shootout losses).  The Detroit Red Wings earned the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] regular season crown with 113 points (50 wins, 19 regulation loses, 13 overtime/shootout losses).

For the first time in NHL history, neither of the two teams that played in the [[2006 Stanley Cup Finals|previous year's Stanley Cup Finals]] (the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the [[Edmonton Oilers]]) qualified for the playoffs. For the first time since [[1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1994]], ''all'' four former [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] teams; Carolina (formerly the [[Hartford Whalers]]), Colorado (formerly the [[Quebec Nordiques]]), Edmonton, and Phoenix (formerly the [[Winnipeg Jets]]) missed the playoffs in the same year.

In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage, which gives them a maximum possible four games on their home ice, with the other team getting a maximum possible three. In the Stanley Cup Final, home ice is determined based on regular season points, giving the Anaheim Ducks home ice for this year's series. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format. This means that the higher-seeded team will have Games 1 and 2, plus 5 and 7 if necessary, played on their home ice, while the lower-seeded team will be at home for the other games. The format ensures that the team with home ice advantage will always have home ice for the "extra" game if there are an odd number of games in a series.

==Conference Quarter-finals==

===Eastern Conference quarter-finals===
====(1) Buffalo Sabres vs. (8) New York Islanders====
The high scoring Buffalo Sabres had completed one of their best regular seasons ever, having won the [[President's Trophy]], awarded to the team amassing the most points in the regular season, with 113 points.

After qualifying for the Eastern Conference Finals in 1993, the Islanders had failed to win a playoff series since then.  After a miserable 2005–06 season, the team hired former [[Buffalo Sabres]] coach [[Ted Nolan]]. Under him the team posted a 92 point season in 2006–07. It was on the final day of the regular season that they clinched a playoff spot with a [[shootout]] victory over the New Jersey Devils.

Game 1 went to Buffalo, but in Game 2 the Islanders beat the Sabres 3–2. However that win was overshadowed by Buffalo winning the next three games to clinch the series and move on to Round 2.

====(2) New Jersey Devils vs. (7) Tampa Bay Lightning====
In the spring of 2003, the Devils and Lightning met up in the western Conference Semi-finals, which the Devils won in five games in the first series between the two teams. The Devils and Lightning met again in 2007. However, Devils general manager [[Lou Lamoriello]], with three games remaining in the regular season, fired head coach [[Claude Julien (ice hockey)|Claude Julien]] so that he could coach the team going into the playoffs.

The Devils and Lightning split the first two games in New Jersey. The Lightning were able to win game three to take a series lead, but Devils center [[Scott Gomez]] scored the overtime goal in game four to tie the series at two games. The Devils then went on to win the next two games to take the series four games to two.

====(3) Atlanta Thrashers vs. (6) New York Rangers====
The Thrashers qualified for the playoffs in 2006–07, their first ever trip to the postseason. General manager [[Don Waddell]] arranged several trade deadline deals that brought winger [[Keith Tkachuk]] and defenceman [[Alexei Zhitnik]] to Atlanta from the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]], respectively. This new veteran leadership helped to propel the young Thrashers into the playoffs. For the Rangers, this was the second straight season in which they qualified for the playoffs after several years of not qualifying, having been swept in four games the season earlier by the Devils. Before the 2007 Playoffs, the last time the playoffs were in Atlanta was in 1980, the year before the Calgary relocation. Coincidently, they too faced the New York Rangers.

This series proved to be no contest, however, as the Rangers swept the series in four games. It was thought that the series would be more evenly matched, and aside from the Rangers 7–0 rout of Atlanta in game three, the scores in the other three games were close. The first two games were decided by one goal, and game four was decided by two goals (one being an empty net goal.)

====(4) Ottawa Senators vs. (5) Pittsburgh Penguins====
The Penguins made the playoffs for the first time in five seasons and there was much hype surrounding youngsters Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and Marc-Andre Fleury's first trip to the Stanley Cup playoffs. Meanwhile, Ottawa made the playoffs for the 10th consecutive year, although there were doubts about their ability to win after a disappointing round 2 loss to the Sabres in the 2006 playoffs and the departure of Zdeno Chara in the offseason.

Ottawa pounced on the inexperienced Penguins early in game 1, scoring two quick first period goals on the way to a dominant 6-3 victory. Game 2 was a seesaw affair with the Penguins playing with more energy. Pittsburgh took the lead early in the first on a goal by Ryan Whitney. Ottawa answered in the 2nd period, taking a 2-1 lead on goals from Spezza and Alfredsson, before perennial Senators nemesis Gary Roberts tied the game at 2 on the powerplay. The Sens would go ahead 3-2 before Staal and Crosby scored in the third to win the second game 4-3 and tie the series 1-1.

The series shifted to Pittsburgh the next afternoon for game 3, with the Penguins hoping to capitalize on their momentum and the quick turnaround. Gary Roberts put them up 1-0 just 52 seconds into the game, but the Senators would score four unanswered goals (including two by captain Daniel Alfredsson) to go up 4-1. A late powerplay goal by Crosby (his third in 3 games) would not be enough and the Senators took a 2-1 series lead. Game 4 would be a much tighter affair, with the Senators winning 2-1 to earn a commanding 3-1 series lead on the strength of a dominant performance by goalie Ray Emery and a late goal from Anton Volchenkov.

The Penguins needed a win in game 5 to extend the series, but could not break through Ray Emery despite four first-period powerplays, including a lengthy 5-on-3 advantage. Heatley, Vermette and Kelly would score in the 2nd period enroute to a 3-0 shutout victory and a 4-1 series win.

===Western Conference quarter-finals===
====(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (8) Calgary Flames====
The Detroit Red Wings tied the Buffalo Sabres for most points in the regular season with 113, but because Buffalo had more victories, Detroit narrowly missed out on winning their third consecutive President's Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team, while the Calgary Flames barely qualified for the playoffs as the number eight seed with 96 points, one point ahead of the ninth place [[Colorado Avalanche]]. The Red Wings and Flames met in the 2004 Western Conference semifinals in which the Flames won in six games, eventually losing in seven games of the Finals that year. The Red Wings were looking to silence their postseason critics and advance to the second round after having lost as the number one seed a year earlier to the eighth seed [[Edmonton Oilers]], who also lost in game seven of the Final. The Flames had also been bounced out of the first round the previous season. The Red Wings made several moves at the trade deadline, acquiring [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and [[Kyle Calder]] while trading away [[Jason Williams (ice hockey)|Jason Williams]]. The Flames made several moves during the regular season as well, trading away [[Andrew Ference]] and [[Chuck Kobasew]] to the [[Boston Bruins]] for [[Brad Stuart]] and [[Wayne Primeau]], as well as re-acquiring [[Craig Conroy]].

In game one, the Red Wings dominated the Flames 4–1, in which Red Wings centre [[Pavel Datsyuk]] scored his first playoff goal since game seven of the 2002 Western Conference Final. Pavel Datsyuk scored again just over a minute into game two, which the Red Wings won 3–1 to take a 2–0 series lead. But the Flames won both games three and four by a 3–2 score, tying the series at two. In game five, the Flames were assessed with several penalties for stick-related infractions during a 5–1 loss, giving Detroit a 3–2 series lead. Most notably, backup goalie [[Jamie McLennan]] slashed Red Wings forward [[Johan Franzén|Johan Franzen]] in the stomach only 18 seconds after relieving [[Mikka Kiprusoff]]. McLennan was immediately ejected from the game, causing Kiprusoff to return to the net; McLennan was later suspended five games. Flames coach [[Jim Playfair]] and the Flames organization were also fined. The Red Wings then eliminated the Flames the next night in Calgary when the game winning double overtime goal was scored, coincidentally, by Johan Franzen. The Red Wings moved on to the second round for the first time since 2004.

====(2) Anaheim Ducks vs. (7) Minnesota Wild====

The [[Anaheim Ducks]] had won their division for the first and only time in franchise history with a franchise best 110 points. It was also the first time they had qualified for the playoffs in back to back years. The [[Minnesota Wild]], only making their second playoff appearance, needed to face the team that had eliminated them in the Conference Final back in 2003.

Game one of the series began at the [[Honda Center]]. Ducks back-up goalie [[Ilya Bryzgalov]] began the series while starter [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] tended to his newborn son. [[Pavol Demitra]] opened the scoring for Minnesota. [[Teemu Selänne|Teemu Selanne]] tied the game on a breakaway, and [[Dustin Penner]] scored the game winner late in the third. Game two was another close game, but the Ducks pulled out a 3–2 win to take a 2–0 series lead at home.

The series shifted to the Xcel Energy Centre for game three. Once again, the Ducks proved to be the superior team as they netted goals from [[Andy McDonald]] and [[Rob Niedermayer]]. [[Petteri Nummelin]] gave the Wild a goal in the last minute of play, but the Ducks held on for a 2–1 win.
In game four, [[Chris Pronger]] opened the scoring for the Ducks. However the Wild took over the game halfway through the second period and managed a 4–1 win to keep the series going. Going back to Honda Centre for game five, Giguere returned to the net and crushed the Wild's hopes by allowing one shot past him. The Ducks won the game 4–1 and eliminated the Wild.

====(3) Vancouver Canucks vs. (6) Dallas Stars====

The [[Vancouver Canucks]] returned to the playoffs after a disappointing 2005–06 season. They had been considered underdogs from the start of the season but ended the season with 105 points, the best in franchise history. This gave them the division championship and a top seed against their first round opponent the [[Dallas Stars]], who had finished with two more points than the Canucks. This was the only seven-game series these playoffs.

Canucks goalie [[Roberto Luongo]] made his first playoff appearance in game one at [[General Motors Place]]. After giving up the lead three times in regulation, [[Henrik Sedin]] won the game when he converted a pass from his brother [[Daniel Sedin|Daniel]] at the 18:06 mark of the fourth overtime. It was the longest game the Canucks ever played, and the sixth longest playoff game in NHL history. Luongo stopped 72 of 76 shots in the 5–4 victory.
The Stars opened game two with a goal just 24 seconds in, and the Canucks were not able to recover as Dallas goaltender [[Marty Turco]] shut them out 2–0. After earning a split in Vancouver, the Stars returned home to [[American Airlines Center]] for game three. Once again, the Stars came out with the opening goal scored by [[Stu Barnes]]. The Canucks tied the game on a [[Jan Bulis]] goal in the third period to send the game to overtime. The Canucks finished the Stars quickly this time as [[Taylor Pyatt]] scored the game winner 7:47 into the first overtime for a 2–1 win.

Game four remained scoreless into the third period. In the end, the Canucks pulled out another 2–1 victory thanks to goals from [[Mattias Öhlund|Mattias Ohlund]] and [[Trevor Linden]]. Back at General Motors Place for game five, both Luongo and Turco pushed aside every shot in regulation, and for the third time in the series, an overtime was needed. At 6:22 mark of the first overtime, Stars captain [[Brenden Morrow]] tipped the winner in off a [[Sergei Zubov]] shot for a 1–0 victory to send the series back to Dallas. In game six, the Stars pulled out a 2–0 win to force a seventh game in Vancouver. Marty Turco recorded his third shutout of the series.

Back in Vancouver for game seven, the Stars dominated the first period and came out with a 1–0 lead. In the second period, Henrik Sedin put the Canucks on the board. It was the Canucks first goal in three games and their first at home since game one. From there on, the Canucks took over the game. Trevor Linden scored the game winner 7:00 into the third. Two empty net goals gave the Canucks a 4–1 win as well as a series win.

====(4) Nashville Predators vs. (5) San Jose Sharks====

The [[Nashville Predators]] made the playoffs for the third straight year. Their first round opponent was the [[San Jose Sharks]] who had eliminated the Predators in five games the year before. The seedings for both teams were the same as the year before, and once again Nashville received home ice advantage.

Game one was an evenly matched game. Both Sharks goalie [[Evgeni Nabokov]] and Predators goalie [[Tomas Vokoun]] were well matched. A goal by [[Matt Carle]] put the Sharks on the board in the first period. Nashville netted goals from [[Alexander Radulov]] and [[Jean-Pierre Dumont]] early in the second, but the Sharks responded with three goals to take a 4–2 lead into the third. The Predators tied the game late in the third as Radulov and Dumont each scored a second goal. [[Patrick Rissmiller]] won the game for the Sharks 8:14 into the second overtime.

In game two, after the Sharks opened the scoring, the Predators went on a scoring spree and ended up winning the game 5–2. At San Jose's [[HP Pavilion at San Jose|HP Pavilion]] for game three, the Predators were considered a big underdog. In five road playoff games in the past, they had yet to win one. The Sharks came out with the greater energy and took the game 3–1. Game four was a "must win" for the Predators. However the Sharks once again came out with the greater energy. Even though the Predators capitalized on a late rush, the Sharks held on for 3–2 win and took a commanding 3–1 series lead back to Nashville. In game five, the Predators and Sharks exchanged two goals. Late in the third, Sharks captain [[Patrick Marleau]] scored the winner to eliminate the Predators for the second year in a row.

==Conference Semi-finals==
===Eastern Conference semi-finals===
====(1) Buffalo Sabres vs. (6) New York Rangers====

The high-scoring [[Buffalo Sabres]] met the surprising [[New York Rangers]] in the [[Eastern Conference Semifinals]] with the two teams coming off first round victories.  The Rangers defeated the higher seeded [[Atlanta Thrashers]] in stunning fashion, sweeping the third seed on the heels of strong play from [[Michael Nylander]] and solid goaltending by [[Henrik Lundqvist]].  The Sabres, who were forced to work harder than they expected, still dominated a [[New York Islanders]] team that earned a playoff berth in a shootout victory on the last day of the regular season, and defeated the eighth seed in 5 games.  The Sabres had won all four games in the season series against the Rangers, leading many to believe this series may have a quick ending.

After a scoreless first period in game one, [[Thomas Vanek]] opened the series scoring with a goal late in the second.  [[Aleš Kotalík|Ales Kotalik]] added another Buffalo tally two minutes later and Vanek chipped in another with 1:36 left in the second.  It seemed that Buffalo was showing their stride from the regular season, as the Sabres cruised to a 5-2 victory.

The Rangers opened the scoring in game two, as [[Martin Straka]] scored a powerplay goal halfway through the first.  However, the Sabres answered less than a minute later on a [[Brian Campbell]] powerplay tally.  Although New York would take back the lead late in the second on a [[Paul Mara]] goal, Buffalo showed their scoring prowess in the third.  [[Chris Drury]] tipped in a [[Toni Lydman]] pass less than a minute into the period and Thomas Vanek scored the game winner halfway through the period off a nifty no-look pass from [[Drew Stafford]] and Buffalo seemed well on their way to the Conference Finals as the series shifted to [[Madison Square Garden]].

However, the Blueshirts proved that they too can win on home ice, winning the game 2-1 on a [[Michal Rozsíval|Michal Rozsival]] double overtime goal.  After a game marked by great goaltending from Lundqvist and Sabres goalie [[Ryan Miller (ice hockey)|Ryan Miller]], Rozsival's point shot finally found the back of the net 16:43 into the second sudden death period.  The goal was huge for Rozsival, as he missed time in game one and gritted through game two with a leg injury.  The game was not without controversy however, as a [[Karel Rachunek]] goal early in the second was overruled after review, with the officials in [[Toronto]] determining the puck had been kicked into the net.

More controversy arose in game four, a 2-1 Rangers victory.  [[Danny Brière|Danny Briere]] appeared to beat Lundqvist with 17 seconds left in the game, but the goal was disallowed after a lengthy review.  Briere appeared to have Lundqvist beat on the short side after a nifty deke, but the overhead camera angle did not provide indisputable evidence that the puck had crossed the line.  Another note from Game 4 was the scratch of Sabres winger [[Maxim Afinogenov]].  Buffalo's sixth leading scorer in the regular season had been underwhelming in the playoffs, and coach [[Lindy Ruff]] was looking to send a message.

Game five was back to Buffalo, and the strong goaltending from the two young keepers continued.  Miller turned away 14 shots through the first two periods until an innocent looking shot by Martin Straka snuck over Miller's shoulder and hit the goal cam in the back of the net with just over 3 minutes left in regulation.  Lundqvist again seemed unbeatable, having stopped the first 36 shots he faced.  However, the 37th Buffalo shot was one that Sabres fans will always remember.  The Sabres pulled their goaltender for a 6 on 5 advantage with the faceoff in the Rangers zone and less than 15 seconds remaining in the game.  Buffalo co-captain Chris Drury won the draw and with 7.7 seconds left found the back of the net on a Tim Connolly rebound and through a Thomas Vanek screen.  The game was not over however, and still another hero would be crowned on this Friday night in the Queen City.  With [[Blair Betts]] off for hooking less than 5 minutes into overtime, Lindy Ruff gave Maxim Afinogenov a chance to redeem himself for his poor play.  Afinogenov came through, getting off a quick slapshot from the point that beat Lundqvist five hole.  Afinogenov took several strides before diving across center ice, and his jubilant teammates joined him in celebration.

Buffalo would carry this momentum back to New York, where the Rangers had yet to lose in the playoffs.  While the Rangers took the lead late in the first, Buffalo exploded for four goals in the second and another in the third, including two by forward [[Jochen Hecht]].  The Rangers would not go down easily however, with [[Michael Nylander]] drawing the Blueshirts within one with less than three minutes to play.  The Sabres however were able to hold on and win the game 5-4, taking the series in six games.  A lasting effect from the series may have been Chris Drury's strong play, as the Rangers signed the pivot to a free agent contract after the season.

====(2) New Jersey Devils vs. (4) Ottawa Senators====

The [[Ottawa Senators]], having eliminated the young [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the opening round, had to face the team that had stopped them one game short of the Stanley Cup Final in 2003. 

Game one of the series began at [[Continental Airlines Arena]]. The Senators came out with all the energy and capitalized on every Devils mistake to jump out to a 4–0 lead. From the second period on, the Devils stole the momentum, and the Senators needed to hold on for a 5–4 victory.

Both teams were ready for game two, but it was the Devils who held a 2–1 lead in the third period. The Senators tied the game late in the third, but [[Jamie Langenbrunner]] scored the winning goal for the Devils 1:55 into the second overtime. Game three at [[Scotiabank Place]] turned out to be a defensive battle. The game remained scoreless into the third period before [[Tom Preissing]] put the Senators on the board. An empty net goal was added for a 2–0 Senators win.
The teams were evenly matched once again in game four,  but the Senators won 3–2.

The Senators returned to Continental Airlines Arena for game five with a chance to finish the series. [[Scott Gomez]] scored for the Devils first, but the Senators responded with three straight goals. Gomez gave the Devils a late third period goal, but the Senators hung on to win 3–2 in the final game ever played at Continental Airlines Arena. The Devils would play at [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]'s[[Prudential Center]] starting next season. The Senators advanced to the Eastern Conference Final for the second time in their history.

===Western Conference semi-finals===
====(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (5) San Jose Sharks====

The Red Wings and Sharks met in the postseason for the first time since 1995, when the Red Wings swept the Sharks in four games. Evgeni Nabokov and the Sharks shut out Detroit in game one in Detroit by a score of 2-0, taking a 1-0 series lead. The Red Wings drew even with a come-from-behind victory in game two, with Pavel Datsyuk scoring the go-ahead goal with 1:24 remaining in the third period.

The series then shifted to San Jose for games three and four. The Sharks won game three with [[Jonathan Cheechoo]] scoring the game winner, taking a 2-1 series lead. After being down 2–1 with less than a minute left in game four, the Red Wings tied the game thanks to [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]], and later won in overtime on a powerplay goal from [[Mathieu Schneider]] to draw the series at 2–2. Detroit then dominated the Sharks back in Detroit in game five, winning 4-1, taking a 3-2 series lead into game six back in San Jose. Two goals from Red Wings winger [[Mikael Samuelsson]] and a [[Dominik Hašek|Dominik Hasek]] shutout won the series for the Red Wings, moving them to the Western Conference Final for the first time since 2002.

====(2) Anaheim Ducks vs. (3) Vancouver Canucks====

After a thrilling seven game series against the [[Dallas Stars]], the Canucks then had to face the Anaheim Ducks. This series featured teams that each had two brothers playing on the same team (the Sedins for Vancouver and the Niedermayers for Anaheim).

After Canucks player [[Jeff Cowan]] opened the scoring in game one within the first eleven minutes, Anaheim answered back with three goals (two by [[Andy McDonald]] and one by [[Teemu Selänne|Teemu Selanne]]) in the first period, plus two additional goals later in the game for a 5–1 win. Game two was a much closer game as Canucks goaltender [[Roberto Luongo]] came back with a better performance than the first game. The game proceeded into double overtime until Vancouver's Jeff Cowan managed to score from a very tight angle to tie the series 1–1 going into Vancouver.

Despite receiving nine penalties (including four straight during the first period) in game three, Anaheim managed to win the game 3–2 in regulation in Vancouver thanks to a game winning slap shot by [[Corey Perry]]. Game four was a different story, however, as Vancouver jumped ahead in scoring 2–0 after two periods in an effort to tie the series. But during the third period, Anaheim came back with goals from Pronger and Selanne to tie the game, plus a goal by [[Travis Moen]] shortly into overtime extended the series lead to 3–1.

In game five, Luongo stopped 47 shots and helped keep the score tied at one after three periods (in the end, the Ducks had 65 shots on goal). At the start of overtime, Vancouver unexpectedly switched goalies, later revealing Luongo had an untimely case of [[diarrhea]]. After [[Dany Sabourin]] successfully stopped Anaheim shots, Luongo returned to the net and kept the game tied going into double overtime. Shortly into the second overtime period, [[Rob Niedermayer]] delivered a hit on [[Jannik Hansen]]. The puck came to [[Scott Niedermayer]], who fired a wrist shot that found the back of the net, giving the Ducks the overtime and series victory, moving them to the Western Conference Final.

Replays showed that Luongo's glove hand was up trying to signal to referees that he thought the hit was an elbow, and the puck went through where his glove should have been. When Luongo was announced as the second star of the game, many at the [[Honda Center]] cheered.

==Conference finals==
===Eastern Conference final===
====(1) Buffalo Sabres vs. (4) Ottawa Senators====
In the previous year, Buffalo, who were the 4 seed, surprised the 1 seeded Senators in the conference semi-final, eliminating them in 5 games. The playoff animosity from the previous year carried on into this year. The Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres had been at each other's throats throughout the season. On February 22, 2007, Ottawa enforcer Chris Neil delivered a controversial hit to Buffalo's [[Chris Drury]], seriously injuring Drury and sparking an in-game brawl between the two teams, which featured a fight between Buffalo player [[Andrew Peters]] and Ottawa goalie [[Ray Emery]] plus a heated argument between coaches [[Bryan Murray (ice hockey)|Bryan Murray]] and [[Lindy Ruff]].

In game one at Buffalo, Ottawa opened the series with goals by [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] and [[Daniel Alfredsson]] respectively to start with a 2–0 lead in the first period of game one. The Sabres answered later in the first and midway through the second period with goals by [[Maxim Afinogenov]] and [[Toni Lydman]] to tie the game 2–2. The Senators then took control of the third period and scored three more goals to win 5–2 and take the series lead.

In game two the Sabres jumped ahead in scoring during the first period with two goals. But Ottawa later caught up and tied the game 2–2 by the second period. Ottawa defenceman [[Wade Redden]] gave the Senators the lead by the end of the second period with a power play goal. Buffalo did not answer until late in the third period on a power play goal by [[Danny Brière|Danny Briere]] with only six seconds left to tie the game. Senators defenceman [[Joe Corvo]] scored just off a faceoff to give Ottawa the double overtime win and a 2–0 lead in the series. This was Ottawa's first 2-0 lead in a series in their history.

Game three, in Ottawa, was kept to no scoring until the second period when Senator Captain Daniel Alfredsson shot a puck that somehow riccocheted off Sabre goalie [[Ryan Miller (ice hockey)|Ryan Miller]] towards Alfredsson who had an open net. Ottawa took a 3–0 lead in the series.

In game four Buffalo started with a goal nine seconds into the game. Buffalo jumped ahead 3–0 in scoring before the Senators came back with two goals. Ottawa could not score a third goal and tie the game, and the Sabres fought back into the series with a 3–2 win.

Game five in Buffalo opened with a Sabre goal. But Ottawa came back and took a 2–1 lead. Afinogenov tied the game for the Sabres midway through the third period to eventually send the game into overtime. However, Daniel Alfredsson eliminated the Sabres by skating and shooting through three Buffalo players and scoring the overtime goal to send the Senators into the Stanley Cup Final.

===Western Conference final===
====(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (2) Anaheim Ducks====

The Western Conference Final featured the number one and two ranked Western Conference teams, the Red Wings and Ducks respectively, competing for a berth in the Stanley Cup Final. This would be the Red Wings' first trip to the Conference Final since their last Cup win in 2002 (they failed to make it past the second round for three consecutive seasons afterwards despite having terrific regular season records), while the Ducks made it for the second time since their [[2003 Stanley Cup playoffs|2003 Stanley Cup run]] in which they lost to New Jersey in seven games.

Detroit opened the series at home in game one with a 2–1 victory, with both goals deflecting off Ducks defensemen. Game two was a different story as the scoring lead shifting between the teams. With the Wings leading 3–2 in the third period, a goal was ruled when the puck somehow crossed the goal line while settling over Hasek's knee as he slid backwards into the net, thus tying the game and sending it into overtime. Scott Niedermayer sealed victory for game two as he scored in overtime to tie the series.

Game three at [[Honda Center]] featured one of the most one-sided games witnessed in the playoffs, as the Red Wings blanked the Ducks 5–0 to take a 2–1 series lead. [[Chris Pronger]] was suspended by the NHL for game four. His suspension was a result of the same hit on [[Tomas Holmström|Tomas Holmstrom]] that [[Rob Niedermayer]] was penalized for. While Pronger received no penalty for the hit during the game, Pronger was later suspended after NHL officials reviewed the replays, which showed Holmstrom being boarded from behind as a result of a Pronger elbow, drawing blood from a cut on his forehead. In game four, without Pronger, the Ducks had to step up their efforts. They dominated the first period with three goals, including a power play goal by [[Ric Jackman]], Pronger's "stand in" for game four in his first game of the playoffs. Detroit would came back after trailing 3–1 to tie the game 3–3 in the second period, only to have the Ducks respond with a stunning wrist shot goal from the blue line by [[Ryan Getzlaf]] and an empty net goal [[Rob Niedermayer]] that gave Anaheim the 5–3 win and tie the series at two games.

The tied series returned to Detroit for game 5. A goal from Detroit defenceman [[Andreas Lilja]] early in the second period put Detroit up 1–0. Throughout the game, the Red Wings dominated the play. Despite their controlling of the play, Detroit was only able to score once because of the strong play of Ducks goaltender [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère|J. S. Giguere]]. Finally, after over 59 minutes of play, the Ducks found the inside of net via a power play goal by Scott Niedermayer with just 47 seconds left in the game. Niedermayer appeared to be attempting a pass to a Ducks player in front of the net, but his pass deflected off Detroit defenceman [[Nicklas Lidström|Nicklas Lidstrom]]'s stick and over [[Dominik Hašek|Dominik Hasek]]'s glove. Halfway into overtime, Andreas Lilja was making a routine breakout play behind his net when fore checking pressure by [[Andy McDonald]] caused Lilja to turn the puck over to [[Teemu Selanne]], who lifted a backhander above a sprawled Hasek to give the Ducks a stunning 2–1 overtime victory and a 3–2 series lead going back to Anaheim. Selanne's goal is considered to be the biggest goal in Ducks' franchise history. Meanwhile for the city of Detroit, this was one of two Game 5 losses suffered by their teams, at home, in OT and in the conference finals round, in the ''same'' postseason year (the other being the [[Detroit Pistons]]' loss to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in Game 5 in the NBA's Eastern Conference Finals).

Game six almost seemed to be anticlimactic after game five starting with a short-handed goal by Rob Niedermayer. The Ducks extended the lead to three in the second period. Early in the third period, Detroit scored a goal by [[Henrik Zetterberg]]. [[Samuel Påhlsson|Samuel Pahlsson]] again extended the Ducks lead by three goals shortly after. Two powerplay goals from [[Pavel Datsyuk]] cut the Ducks' lead to only one late in the game. But despite the late period pressure, the Anaheim Ducks were able to hold on and win the game and the series to advance to the Stanley Cup Final for the second time in their history.
