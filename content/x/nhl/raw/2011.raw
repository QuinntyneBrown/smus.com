==Playoff bracket==
In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Thus, the Vancouver Canucks have home ice advantage in this year's Finals. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team plays at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the lower-seeded team is at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary).

====(2) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (7) Buffalo Sabres====
The Philadelphia Flyers entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference after winning the Atlantic Division with 106 points, winning the tiebreaker over the Pittsburgh Penguins on regulation + overtime wins (44 to 39). The Buffalo Sabres earned the seventh seed with 96 points, losing the tiebreaker to Montreal on regulation + overtime wins (38 to 41). This was the ninth meeting of these two teams in the postseason; Philadelphia had won five of the eight previous playoff series. Their previous matchup occurred during the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals]], which ended with Buffalo defeating Philadelphia in six games.

The series started out with a shutout victory for Buffalo Sabres goaltender Ryan Miller in Game 1, while the Flyers came back winning Games 2 and 3. Ryan Miller got yet another shutout victory in Game 4, to tie the series up 2-2. In Game 5, the Sabres were up 3-0, but the Flyers rallied back with goals from James van Riemsdyk, Andrej Meszaros, and Daniel Briere. Tied at 3, the game was sent to overtime in which Tyler Ennis put in his second of the night and won it for the Sabres. In Game 6, the Sabres looked in good position to win after being up 3-1 after the 1st period, but the Flyers rallied back, winning the game 5-4 on Ville Leino's overtime winner. In Game 7, the Flyers went up 4-0 about 2 minutes into the 3rd period on a wicked backhander by Ville Leino. Due to that, Sabres goaltender Ryan Miller was pulled for the first time in the series, and the Flyers won 5-2 to win the series 4-3.

Canada Sports}}</ref> The previous meeting of these teams in the postseason was in [[2009 Stanley Cup playoffs|2009]], which ended with Boston sweeping Montreal.

In this series, the Boston Bruins dropped their first 2 games at home in Boston, but came back to hang on to a Game 3 victory in Montreal. In Game 4, Andrei Kostitsyn gave the Montreal Canadiens a 3-1 lead, which they couldn't take advantage of, falling 5-4 on an overtime goal by former Montreal Canadien Michael Ryder. Game 5 was sent into double overtime for Nathan Horton to win it 2-1 for the Bruins. The Canadiens scored twice on 5-on-3 power plays in Game 6, to win it 2-1. Game 7 was also forced into overtime, where Nathan Horton won the game 4-3 and sent the Bruins to the second round of the playoffs. Three of four Bruins victories against Montreal came in overtime.

On April 10, the scheduled date of the French-language [[Canadian federal election, 2011|Canadian federal election]] debate between party leaders was changed from April 14 to April 13 so it would not conflict with Game one of the series.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Canadian: NHL trumps debate date |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadavotes2011/story/2011/04/10/cv-election-debats-duceppe.html |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |date=April 10, 2011 |work=CBC|first=James|last=Fitz-Morris}}</ref>

====(2) San Jose Sharks vs. (7) Los Angeles Kings====
The San Jose Sharks entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after winning the Pacific Division with 105 points. The Los Angeles Kings earned the seventh seed with 98 points.This was the first meeting of these teams in the postseason.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sharks, Kings set for California grudge match |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=559097&navid=DL|NHL|Playoffs2011Round1Series6 |accessdate=April 12, 2011 |date=April 10, 2011 |work=NHL.com}}</ref>

The series started out with a bang in Game 1, with Dany Heatley scoring only 28 seconds into the game. That game was later on won by [[Joe Pavelski]] in overtime, but a good response by the Kings in Game 2 gave them a 4-0 shut out victory in San Jose. In Game 3, San Jose became the fifth team in NHL playoff history to win a game by after being faced with a 4–0 deficit, where [[Devon Setoguchi]] won the game 6-5 in overtime. Still at home, the Kings lost by 3 goals in Game 4. The Kings forgot all about Games 3 and 4, and looked like a completely different team in Game 5, winning it 3-1 in San Jose, but that wasn't enough, because [[Joe Thornton]] won Game 6 in overtime for the San Jose Sharks, who advanced to the second round.

====(2) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (3) Boston Bruins====
This was sixth playoff series between these two teams. It was a rematch of the second-round series that was played the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|previous year]], in which Philadelphia defeated Boston in seven games. Boston won the first three games of the 2010 series; however, Philadelphia rallied to win the final four games, and became the third team in NHL history to win a series by coming back from a 3–0 series deficit. However, in the 2011 series, Philadelphia was not able to repeat that feat, as Boston swept Philadelphia out of the playoffs to move to the [[NHL Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] for the first time since [[1992 Stanley Cup playoffs|1992]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2010030224|title=Bruins make amends, finish sweep of Flyers|date=May 7, 2011|first=Shawn P.|last=Roarke|work=NHL.com|publisher=National Hockey League}}</ref> This series featured some goaltending trouble for Philadelphia; Boston outscored Philadelphia 20–7 in four games. Brian Boucher started the first three games, but was pulled in all three: he was removed from Games 1 and 3 due to performance, and he was briefly removed from Game 2 due to injury. In all, Philadelphia started three different goaltenders in the 11 games that they played in the 2011 playoffs; six of those games featured a change of goalie.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=ap-flyers-wrapup&print=1|title=Flyers fall flat in postseason, swept in 2nd round|date=May 7, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2011|first=Dan|last=Gelston|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo!

Since the [[New York Islanders]] twice forced a game seven after being down 3–0 during the [[1974–75 NHL season|1975 Stanley Cup playoffs]], there had been 112 consecutive failed attempts to repeat that feat prior to the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs]], after which it has happened in three of the seven possible series.<ref>http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=562511</ref><ref>http://twitter.com/#!/NHLdilo/status/68365875224391680</ref> San Jose won the seventh game by a score of 3–2 to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead. Six of the games were decided by only one goal; the only exception was a 3–1 win for Detroit in game six, in which [[Darren Helm]] of Detroit scored an empty net goal.

====(3) Boston Bruins vs. (5) Tampa Bay Lightning====
This is the first playoff series between these teams. Boston won three of the four games that were played in the regular season. Bruins rookie [[Tyler Seguin]] scored a goal and an assist in his first career playoff game in Game 1. In Game 2 he tied the NHL record for points in a single playoff period with four points, two goals and two assists. The 1–0 Game 7 Boston victory featured remarkable discipline from both teams, as no penalties were called during the game. This was the first time this has happened in the playoffs in over twenty years. [[Nathan Horton]] recorded his second Game 7 winning goal in this year's playoffs. His first was scored against Montreal in round one.

=== Western Conference Finals ===
====(1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (2) San Jose Sharks====
This was the first playoff series between these teams. Vancouver won three of the four games that were played in the regular season; their only loss to San Jose came in a shootout. Both Vancouver and San Jose played in a series during the 2011 playoffs (Quarterfinals and Semifinals, respectively) where each took a 3–0 series lead, only to see the opposing team win the next three games to force a seventh game. However, both won their respective seventh games to advance to the next round of the playoffs. San Jose, facing elimination in game five, held a 2–1 lead near the end of the game, until Ryan Kesler forced overtime by scoring with only 13.2 seconds left in the third period. After a scoreless first overtime, Kevin Bieksa would score the series-winning goal 10:18 into the second overtime, to send Vancouver to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]]. The Canucks had previously won the Western Conference Finals on May 24, 1994, 17 years to the day before this year's Conference Finals win. Both games went to double overtime.

As the Presidents' Trophy winners, the Vancouver Canucks had home ice advantage over the Boston Bruins in this year's Finals. This is the first playoff series between Vancouver and Boston. Vancouver and Boston met only once in the regular season, on February 26. Boston won that game by a score of 3–1. This is Vancouver's third appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals; in both of their previous appearances, they lost to a team from New York. In [[1982 Stanley Cup Finals|1982]], they were swept by the [[New York Islanders|Islanders]]. In [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]], they lost to the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] in seven games. This is Boston's first appearance in the Finals since their five-game loss to the Edmonton Oilers in the [[1990 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Boston last won the Stanley Cup in [[1972 Stanley Cup Finals|1972]], when they defeated the New York Rangers in six games.
