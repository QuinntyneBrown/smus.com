{% block description %}
While at CMU, my team conducted a full research, design cycle and eventually
implemented School Connect. This mobile app lets parents peruse events,
curriculum and progress related to their childâ€™s schooling. A prototype was
implemented in jQuery Mobile. I was the project and tech lead.
