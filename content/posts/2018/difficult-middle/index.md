The Difficult Middle

Monism gives life meaning through a single all-encompassing lens. The most
common kind is religion, but other kinds exist too. Some are political
ideologies like Marxism and Fascism, others are less obvious, [like some takes
on Rationalism][chapman-rationalism]. If you manage to convince yourself, life
becomes wonderful!

Because adherents of Monist beliefs tend to be fervent believers, it's easy to
become convinced by social means. In the 1960s, a high school teacher named Ron
Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how the German
population could have claimed ignorance of The Holocaust during World War 2,
decided to demonstrate it to them instead. Jones started a movement called ["The
Third Wave"][jones] and told his students that the movement aimed to eliminate
democracy. It worked a little too well, and at the end of the experiment, Jones
revealed his agenda:

A less obvious example of this is a form of enlightenment rationality, which,
despite combining multiple ideas, can become a complete worldview sealed off
from other ideas:

The extreme opposite of monism is nihilism: nothing has any meaning at all:

# Synthesis

Monism and nihilism are two extremes, one extreme in meaning, and another
extreme in lack of meaning.

[One need not choose between them][false-dilemma]. [Rationalists know
this][third-alternative]. [Buddhists know this][middle-way].  Philosophers knows
this too:

> The enemy of pluralism is monism -- the ancient belief that there is a single harmony of truths into which everything, if it is genuine, in the end must fit. The consequence of this belief (which is something different from, but akin to, what Karl Popper called essentialism -- to him the root of all evil) is that those who know should command those who do not. – [Isaiah Berlin][berlin]

Berlin's pluralism is not a set of coherent beliefs, but a mutually
contradictory set of them:

> But more-recent philosophers such as Isaiah Berlin, sobered by the 20th century’s failed utopias, have argued for a more modest liberal pluralism that makes room for multiple, genuinely conflicting goods. Family and work, solidarity and autonomy, tradition and innovation are really valuable, and really in tension, in both the lives of individuals and the life of a nation. One challenge for enlightenment now is to build social institutions that can bridge and balance these values. – [Alison Gopnik][gopnik]

And so, we are stuck forever trying to find the right balance, sometimes
peering too far into the meaningless abyss of nihilism, and sometimes lounging
too deep into the meaningful certainty of monism. On balance, I pray we end up
in the difficult middle.
