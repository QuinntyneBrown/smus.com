Link's Awakening LEGO Mosaic
===
posted: September 13, 2019

A parismonious use of pixels (160 x 114) and color (four-color greenscale) lends
itself super well to reproduction as a LEGO mosaic! LEGO has this amazing
service called
[Pick-a-Brick](https://www.lego.com/page/static/pick-a-brick#shopxlink) where
you can buy spare parts that accidentally ended up in your vacuum cleaner's
dustbin. Or you can buy tiles and flats and make an awesome mosaic based on your
favorite 2-bit sprite. But how many tiles of each color do you need? Not to
worry, I've got you covered with this [color counting
script](https://github.com/borismus/lego-mosaic/blob/master/count_colors.py).
Fully assembled, two-bit LEGO Link makes an excellent coaster for the office
mug.

I'm not much of a gamer, but Zelda is the one series that continues to occupy a
special place in my heart. Link's Awakening was my first, and remains my
favorite. Twenty five years later, the most memorable part of the game was of
course [the music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NccSaUwoibM). But the
graphics were amazing in their own right. This to me is concentrated nostalgia:

The mosaic is based directly on the most iconic sprite from the game: Link and
his shield strolling sideways through Koholint Island. Here's the colorized
version from the DX version:

I tried making a Link mosaic from my second favorite, Zelda: Link to the Past.
Unfortunately, a 16-bit color palette is way harder to replicate with LEGO's
limited set of colors, and the result isn't worth sharing.
