One day I had some friends over at my house showing me some cool iPad
games. One of the games was Osmos, also available on OS X, developed by
an Canadian indie studio called [Hemisphere Games][hg]. You control a
little blob that floats in 2D space, and the only thing your blob can do is
shoot pieces of yourself in a given direction, which propels it in the
opposite direction. The rules of the game are simple, following
directly from conservation of mass and energy, the main rule being that
when two blobs collide, the larger one will consume the smaller one. My
description is pretty dry, so [see for yourself][osmos] - it's way better than
it sounds!

Osmos really caught my attention because of its simple but engaging gameplay,
meditative pace and distinct **lack of multiplayer support**, which struck me
as a potentially very interesting problem to tackle. And so, [osmus][] (mu for
multiplayer) was born as a browser-based multiplayer Osmos clone.

## How osmus works

When a browser navigates to the osmus landing page, the server sends the new
client the current state of its universe, which is composed of blobs with
randomized velocities. At this point, the client can passively watch the game
progress. For a more interactive experience, players can join the game as a
named blob. Once a player joins, he can click or tap (on mobile) the canvas to
shoot off a new blob in that direction and propel his blob in the opposite
direction.

As the game progresses, the server decides when someone (possibly one of the
autonomous blobs) is victorious, at which point, players are notified and the
game is restarted. The game can be viewed as a simple state machine:

![state][]

The rest of this post is about some of deeper development-related details
So if you just want to play, [go ahead][osmus]. Osmus works on Chrome Stable
(version 13) and iPad.

Before I go, let me jump briefly into some of the issues I encountered when
developing this game. I hope to have a more complete account in a future
articles.

## Game architecture

I wrote osmus to be split into distinct, loosely coupled components both to
make the codebase more approachable for other contributors, and to make it easy
to experiment with interchangeable technologies.

![architecture][]

Osmus uses a shared game engine that runs in both the browser and on
the server. The engine is a simple state machine whose primary function
is to compute the next game state as a function of time using the rules of
physics defined within.

    Game.prototype.computeState = function(delta) {
      var newState = {};
      // Compute a bunch of stuff based on this.state
      return newState;
    }

This is a pretty narrow definition of a *Game Engine*. In the game developer
world, what's typically meant by a game engine may include anything from a
renderer, sound player, networking layer, [etc][engine]. In this case, I've
made very clear divisions between these components, and the osmus game core
only includes just the physical state machine, so that both client and server
can compute the next states and be reasonably synchronized in time.

The client is composed of three main components: a renderer, input
manager and sound manager. I built a very simple canvas-based renderer
that draws blobs as red circles, and player blobs are green ones. My
colleague [Arne Roomann-Kurrik][arne] wrote an alternative
[three.js][3js] based renderer with some epic shaders and shadows.

The sound manager handles playback of both the background music (taken from
[8-bit Magic][8bit]) and sound effects. The current implementation uses audio
tags, with two `<audio>` elements, one for the background music channel, and
one for the sound effects. There are known limitations of this approach, but
given the modularity of this implementation, can be swapped out for one that
uses Chrome's [Web Audio API][webaudio], for example.

Finally, the input manager handles mouse events, but can be replaced with one
that uses touch instead, for a mobile version. In the mobile context, it will
likely make sense to use CSS3 transformations instead of canvas, since CSS3 is
hardware accelerated on iOS, while HTML5 canvas still isn't, and WebGL is not
implemented.

On that note, I'm happy to mention that osmus works pretty well on iPad,
especially on an iPad 2 running the latest iOS version. This is really great,
and one of the tangible benefits of writing games for the open web.

## Networking is hard

From a networking perspective, a game is a rather ambitious project that
requires seamless real-time synchronization between clients. Because of this,
bidirectional client-server communication is essential. In the modern web
stack, this is provided by [Web Sockets][sockets] which supply a thin layer
above TCP and hide a lot of gory details from the implementer. To further hide
network stack details, I use the [socket.io][] library, which provides a dead
simple event-driven abstraction for the whole thing.

From a bit of research which included this [nice talk from Rob Hawkes][rob], it
became clear that to have any sort of shared experience, the simplest model is
to have the true game state on the server, and have clients periodically sync
with it.  The main trade off here is synchronization quality vs. network
traffic required.

On one extreme, a game can be written by having the game logic entirely on the
server and sending updates (or perhaps even [simply screenshots][onlive]) to
the client at 60 FPS, but this is generally not feasible due to the sheer
amount of bandwidth required for this model. On the opposite extreme, you can
imagine a network architecture in which clients connect, get initial state, and
are then largely autonomous.

In practice, there is a happy medium in which many multiplayer games fall,
which means replicating non-trivial code in both the client and the server.
Luckily, now that we're in the ubiquitous JavaScript era, there is no longer a
need to duplicate functionality, but can instead share code by writing the game
engine in JavaScript, and then running it in both a browser on the client, and
in [node.js][] on the server.

## Shared JS modules

As mentioned earlier, osmus uses a physics engine that's shared between clients
and the server, which is written in the same language (JavaScript). One might
imagine that sharing code would be a breeze, but it's not that simple.

Module loaders are a mess. There's the [CommonJS spec][commonjs],
[RequireJS library][requirejs] and node.js require system, none of which play
nicely together. If you want to share code between client and server (one of
the big wins of JS on the server) without a module loader, you can use this
somewhat hacky pattern:

    (function(exports) {

    var MyClass = function() { /* ... */ };
    var myObject = {};

    exports.MyClass = MyClass;
    exports.myObject = MyObject;

    })(typeof global === "undefined" ? window : exports);

This hack relies on the fact that node.js defines a `global` object while the
browser does not. With the hack, node.js `require()` will be happy, and you can
also include the file in a `<script>` tag without polluting your namespace,
assuming of course, that no other JS pollutes your namespace with a
`window.global` object!

Unfortunately this approach only works well for one shared module. As soon as
you have multiple modules depending on each other (via `require`s in node-land,
and globals in browser-land), the difference between node's namespacing and
browser's inclusion becomes painfully apparent and requires more hacky
workarounds.

Another approach is to use [browserify][] to bundle all JS and emulate
requires in the browser. This approach relies on node.js to serve the
generated JS, which is not ideal, since static files should be served by a
[webserver][nginx] optimized for the purpose. However node.js + browserify can
be configured to compile JS that can be served statically without relying on
node to serve it. This approach introduces some overhead:

1. Extra build step for deploying.
2. Performance overhead of whatever mechanism browserify uses to support
   `require()` calls.

Overall this approach sounds better to me, and I hope to try it out in a future
version of osmus.

## Your turn

Today I'm releasing [osmus][] as a completely open source HTML5 game. Feel
free to [fork it][git] to your heart's content. Oh, and for other game related
goodness, check out this article on [HTML5 canvas performance][h5r] recently
posted on html5rocks.
