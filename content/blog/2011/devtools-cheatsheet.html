Chrome's Developer Tools have been getting much deserved love at this last
Google I/O. Paul Irish and I started with an [bootcamp lab][], a hands-on 
walk through tweaking a web application using the developer tools. We handed
out a cheatsheet to give developers an overview of available features.

Thanks to the awesome I/O organizers, we also gave away free HTML5 cake (as
promised) after the session ended:

The developer tools were also featured at the [start of the Chrome keynote][]
with a webkit-speech demo. Finally, Pavel Feldman (lead engineer for the dev
tools) and Paul gave an great [I/O talk][].

One of the most promising aspects of the Chrome Developer Tools is that they
are easy to extend with (experimental) [chrome extension APIs][]. I'm stoked to
see what people create to make these developer tools even better!
