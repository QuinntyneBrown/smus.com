I just returned from a work trip to São Paulo, Brazil. I gave four Chrome/HTML5
presentations and talked to many engineers and designers over the course of the
week, trying hard not to sound like a broken record. Luckily Brazil has a lot
of people so the audiences were different each time, and hopefully the content
remained fresh and interesting (at least to them). The most entertaining part
of the Chrome tour was when I spilled water all over my coworkers laptop
mid-presentation (sorry Otavio!)

The rest of this post is a made of mini-vignettes because I'm too lazy to write
in complete sentences, and can also be supplemented with [travel photos][].

## Food

* Delicious fruits of all varieties: exotic cashew, persimmon, star fruit, guyava, way tastier bananas.
* Massive portions of sashimi at japanese restaurants.
* Rodizio is super exquisite. Largest salad bar ever, including caviar (srsly).

## Infrastructure

* Concrete jungle like nothing I've ever seen. The whole city is built up within a 60km radius.
* Chaotic traffic patterns and insane motorcyclists abound. Everyone loves to drive between lanes and honk gratuitously.
* Super bumpy roads date back to the dictatorship days. If you take the wrong exit, prepare to jump around.
* Helicopters fly all over town and sometimes land precariously close to unsuspecting window cleaners dangling from highrise roofs.
* Foul smelling river and slums on the way to a meeting on Friday morning.

## Work

* Super friendly people but my Portuguese skills failed to topple the language barrier.
* Long process to get into any office building. Some ask for ID, others ask for passport. Takes half an hour just to get in...
* Somehow, Google Brazil still feels like Google!
