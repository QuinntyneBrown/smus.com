A few weekends ago I went to the jQuery Conference held at the MS campus in
Mountain View. And I took notes! 

## State of jQuery

Resig talked about a bunch of changes to the project structure, largely
irrelevant to jQuery library consumers.

Many jQuery 1.6 improvements:

* Rewrite of attr() and val(). For example, attr('val', false) removes the attribute
* Separate prop() from attr(). Indeed!
* $('input:focus') gets focused input box across platforms
* Significant performance boosts:
  * attr() performance ~85% faster, val() ~150% faster, data() ~115% faster
* Integration with requestAnimationFrame for animations
* $.map(Object, function) now works (as it does for Arrays)

Pro tip: jQuery automatically parses serialized JSON if it's included as the value 
of a HTML5 data attribute. Example: `<header data-array="[0,1,2]">` then 
`$('header').data('array')[1] == 1`
