Now that the Vancouver Canucks are in the NHL Finals, a special visit to
Vancouver is in order. Unfortunately, the recently posted schedule really
sucks. There's just one weekend game, and the rest are spaced in such a way
that I can only hope to see Game 5 (if it happens) and either Game 4 or Game 6
(if it happens) if I manage to work from home half of the week. The question
is: which game to choose? I want to be in Vancouver when the Canucks
take the cup!

## Yay math!

Bring super nerdy, I decided to throw math at the problem. Brushing up on
probability, I calculated the odds of a series ending at each game (4-7). For a
series to end in game 4, one team has to win all four games. The odds of this,
given a 50% chance for each team to win, is (1/2)^4. Since there are two teams,
multiply by two, resulting in a 1/8 chance. You can do similar calcuations to
get the following odds:

    p(4)   p(5)   p(6)   p(7)
    0.125  0.25   0.3125 0.3125

Based on this distribution, it seems that game 6 is more likely to see the end
of the series than game 4, but then I would risk missing a game 4 victory. 
[Sir Ken Robinson][] would be proud of this student of statistics.

## A bit of history

Historical data tells a different story. As it turns out, the NHL is really
old, dating back to YYYY, but the league switched to best-of-7 scoring in YYYY.
Also, wikipedia has a great chronology of NHL playoffs, complete with scores
and brackets.

I analyzed series scores from all playoff games in the last 25 years (since
1985) by fetching raw wikipedia articles via wget and running them through a
[python script]. Older records can also be found on wikipedia, but they are
buried inside other pages, in harder to parse formats.

    for year in {1985..2011} do
      wget -O ${year} "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=${year}_Stanley_Cup_playoffs&action=raw"
    done

This yielded the following distribution for playoff games, based on 383
matches:

    p(4)   p(5)   p(6)   p(7)
    0.16   0.24   0.33   0.27

For finals games only, the distribution is more skewed, probably in part
due to a shortage of data (just NN finals games from the [wikipedia page][]):

    p(4)   p(5)   p(6)   p(7)
    0.28   0.24   0.27   0.21

Here are all three distributions plotted in a graph:

## Decision point

The most striking thing about this graph is the huge difference between finals
history and stats. Perhaps some teams just buckle under the pressure, while
their opponents remain steadfast. Or perhaps this is just a statistically
insignificant fluke that can be attributed to too few finals matches.

As expected, the historical distributions are skewed toward the series
finishing in Game 4 due to unequal strength between teams. In other words, if
one team is slightly stronger than another, then the odds of that team winning
each game would be greater, making the series shorter on average.

What's odd about this, though, is this skewing doesn't extend to Game 5, for
which the odds of finishing are lower than via pure stats.

Armed with numbers, I can decide whether to pick Game 4 or Game 6.  From the
stats alone, the odds of seeing the Canucks win in Games 4 or 5 is 38% while
the odds of seeing the victory in Games 5 or 6 is 58%. From all playoff games,
the odds are, 40% and 57% respectively, and from just finals, the odds are 52%
and 51%.

The bottom line, though, is probability be damned, I would hate to miss a Game
4 victory. Now to try to work from home, book flights and bask in Canuck glory!
